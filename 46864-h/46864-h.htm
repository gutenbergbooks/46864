      frosty evening in December, seventeen hundred and ninety-five, and the
      whole of the month had been unusually tempestuous. Throughout wide
      Britain, there are no shores on which the wind rages with wilder fury than
      upon those naked promontories which abut into the Atlantic, along the
      iron-bound coast of Donegal. Harbours are few and far between&mdash;the
      peasantry are a hardy and adventurous race&mdash;and the fishing grounds
      distant from the land. In the winter, snowstorms come suddenly on, and the
      sea rises with fearful rapidity. The boatmen are caught in the gale, and
      too frequently courage and skill struggle in vain,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and a calamitous loss of life robs many a family of its protectors, making
      the humble roof-tree desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the continuation of these fearful storms, this wild coast had not
      escaped its customary visitations. An island smack had foundered with all
      its crew; and farther to the northward, a transport, homeward-bound from
      Holland with sick and wounded soldiers, having been dismasted in the gale,
      was driven a wreck upon the coast. By the fearless intrepidity of some
      fishermen, the sinking vessel was carried through a fissure in the rocks
      into a sandy bay; and, by what appeared miraculous interposition, the
      lives of all on board were saved, even when hope was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second evening after this fortunate deliverance our story opens.
      Indeed, the epoch was memorable. That disastrous campaign which brought
      disgrace upon the British arms, had just terminated in the evacuation of
      the Low Countries, and the withdrawal to its own shores of the débris of a
      splendid force, which, under luckless auspices, had left England buoyant
      with the assurance of success. Nor was a foreign failure the only
      circumstance which at this eventful period gave cause for apprehension. In
      England, the public mind was agitated, monetary confidence deeply shaken,
      and revolutionary principles were gaining ground; while in Ireland the
      peasantry united in lawless associations, and murder, with robbery of
      arms, intimated that some insurrectionary movement was at hand. In a word,
      everything was gloomy and discouraging abroad, and at home life and
      property had no security. With few exceptions the resident gentry had
      repaired for protection to garrisoned towns. Some however, with more
      spirit than discretion, determined to remain within their houses, and my
      father was of that number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there were few persons excepting its owner, who, even in peaceful
      times, would choose Knockloftie for an abiding place. It was an old and
      dreary-looking fabric,&mdash;one portion consisting of a dark square
      tower, the keep of a former stronghold of the O&rsquo;Hallorans,&mdash;and the
      others, additions built at different periods, according to the wants or
      fancies of succeeding proprietors. The house was perched upon a cliff,
      which rose in sheer ascent two hundred feet above the beach beneath it.
      Although sheltered by some high grounds behind, still, as the building
      looked upon the ocean, it was necessarily exposed and cold; while dwarfed
      and sickly copse-wood&mdash;all that repeated efforts to grow timber could
      produce&mdash;instead of improving the general appearance of the place,
      gave a silent but striking evidence of its hopeless sterility.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my father, however, Knockloftie had hereditary endearments. For five
      centuries his ancestors had been born and died there; and he clung with a
      family attachment to that ancient roof-tree, where the O&rsquo;Hallorans, in
      better days, had exercised a boundless hospitality, which even yet was
      chronicled in the traditions of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But local associations apart, my father would have scorned to yield to the
      threatening appearances of the times, and leave his mansion in alarm. He
      was &ldquo;every inch&rdquo; a soldier; and in all relations between landlord and
      tenant, it was universally admitted that he was both liberal and kind. He
      had vainly endeavoured to rouse the spirit of the gentry, and induce them,
      by bold and united efforts, to crush the increasing disaffection; and at a
      recent county meeting, after delivering a stirring appeal, he concluded by
      a declaration, that, &ldquo;while the old tower of Knockloftie had a roof, it
      never should want an arm to defend it,&rdquo;&mdash;and he raised his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran had failed to produce the reaction he desired,
      still the bold example he had given was not without effect. The government
      was appealed to for assistance, rewards were offered largely for the
      apprehension of the guilty, vigorous measures proposed and agreed to, and
      the dormant energies of the aristocracy seemed awakening. Of course, my
      father occupied a prominent place in the estimation of both the loyal and
      the disaffected. With the former he was considered the master-spirit, who
      was to direct them in this their hour of difficulty; while the latter set
      him down as the most dangerous enemy they had to dread. In a moment,
      former kindness and consequent popularity vanished like a dream, the <i>delenda
      est</i> of Knockloftie was pronounced, and in the black list to guide the
      future murderer my father&rsquo;s name stood first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of the times, and such the local condition of the
      country in which the opening scene of this true history is laid. My first
      anniversary had come round; and although the hospitable relations which
      had formerly existed among the gentry had been interrupted, still, on this
      occasion, there was a semblance of rejoicing in my father&rsquo;s house, though,
      sooth to say, it was after all a sickly effort at festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great chamber of Knockloftie the lord of the mansion, with his lady
      and two guests, were seated. The apartment was a large, square, and
      ill-lit room, occupying the lower portion of the tower. Both floor and
      ceiling were framed of native oak, which time had nearly blackened, and
      the walls were half-concealed by portraits rudely executed. Many
      indications of the danger of the times were apparent in this ancient
      chamber. The windows were jealously secured, and everywhere weapons of all
      descriptions were seen. Two arm-racks, holding a dozen muskets each, were
      placed in either corner, while some silver sconces dependent from the
      cornice shed on the polished arms a flickering light. But the chamber was
      better illuminated; for the huge hearth was heaped with bog-wood, and the
      ruddy flare this cheerful fire emitted reached the remotest extremity of
      the apartment, and half-dispelled its gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Scott would say, &ldquo;the tables were drawn,&rdquo; and dinner had disappeared.
      My mother sat in an antique high-backed chair, busily employed in knitting
      shooting-stockings for her husband; my father had extracted another cork;
      the parson pronounced the wine unexceptionable; and the priest, &ldquo;good easy
      man,&rdquo; was stirring an obdurate piece of sugar, deposited in the bottom of
      his second tumbler. The clock upon the mantelpiece struck seven, and the
      butler, after replenishing a bent-basket with firewood, quitted the
      presence and closed the door. All these events had passed, and it is high
      time that the gentle reader should be formally introduced to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of my parents must be intermixed. Lieutenant-Colonel Denis
      O&rsquo;Halloran was now some thirty-one, but he looked older by a dozen years.
      He was a tall, athletic man, well formed and well set-up, with an air and
      bearing which did not require the attestation of an empty sleeve, to prove
      him &ldquo;no carpet knight&rdquo; and stamp him soldier. He entered the service a boy
      of sixteen&mdash;and at six-and-twenty, the women said he was the
      handsomest fellow in garrison. At twenty-seven, the old major having
      signified his intention to retire, my grandsire, <i>more Hibernico</i>,
      secured his son&rsquo;s promotion by parting with another town-land. At
      twenty-eight, Major O&rsquo;Halloran further promoted himself, for he carried
      off the pretty brunette who was now demurely knitting stockings in the
      corner. Heaven forgive him!&mdash;my mother was boarder in a convent&mdash;and
      one blessed moonlight morning, when the nuns were dreaming of heaven, and
      the superior sleeping &ldquo;fast as a watchman,&rdquo; with the assistance of a
      ladder and three grenadiers, Miss Emily Clifford was liberated from holy
      pupilage, and at Gretna Green she became Mrs. O&rsquo;llalloran, and that too,
      without taking the opinion of the parish as to whether there was just
      cause or impediment against the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was the only daughter of a Catholic gentleman of large estate,
      he had however a son by a former marriage, fifteen years older. The boy
      grew up wild and extravagant&mdash;and at twenty-one had dissipated a
      handsome fortune. At last his angry parent totally discarded him, and to
      support his endless debaucheries, the unhappy youth resorted to
      discreditable means for obtaining the money he required. With some
      profligate companions he became involved in a transaction which rendered
      them obnoxious to the law, and in consequence, Edward Clifford left
      England secretly. Eighteen years had elapsed&mdash;none eould say whether
      he was dead or living&mdash;but the general belief was, that he filled an
      early and dishonoured grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford was a bigot in religion. All his hopes had long since
      centered in his daughter; and the great object of his life was to marry
      her to a person of his own persuasion, and a union was negotiated, and
      nearly concluded, between Emily and the son of a Catholic peer. In the
      meantime, her education had been entrusted to the sisterhood of a convent,
      alike celebrated for sanctity and strictness, where, as Mr. Clifford
      believed, his daughter would be equally secure against attempts upon her
      faith or her affections. What must have been his rage and astonishment
      when the news of her elopement was communicated! She who had been designed
      to wed a peer&mdash;whose loved society he had relinquished, that her
      religious opinions might be confirmed by spiritual instruction&mdash;she
      was lost to him for ever; united by an indissoluble tie to the son of a
      distressed gentleman&mdash;and worse still, to the professor of a creed
      from which Mr. Clifford fearfully recoiled, as a system founded in heresy
      and error.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a sufficient time had been allowed to permit the first burst of
      parental displeasure to exhaust itself, letters were written to Mr.
      Clifford by the offenders, to deprecate his anger and solicit pardon and
      forgiveness; but they came back with unbroken seals, while other
      circumstances concurred to convince my parent that, for a time at least,
      the old gentleman&rsquo;s anger was implacable. Rich in mutual regard, they
      sought and found consolation in reciprocated affections&mdash;and soon
      after there was promise of another tie, that should bind their hearts
      together even more closely than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short was the season when their course of love ran smooth. An order of
      readiness arrived unexpectedly from the war office&mdash;the destination
      of the regiment was France&mdash;and in another week a rout was received
      for Deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A separation was now inevitable&mdash;and when my mother most required a
      husband&rsquo;s gentle attentions, the order to divide them had arrived. But the
      rector of her father&rsquo;s parish had heard of the intended embarkation, and
      hastened to offer the home my mother needed. Thus, cheered by &ldquo;the good
      man&rsquo;s counsels,&rdquo; and nursed tenderly by his excellent wife, my mother gave
      birth, in four months afterwards to a son&mdash;I made an <i>entrée</i> on
      the world,&mdash;and commenced, as the reader may probably admit
      hereafter, an adventurous career.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young soldier&rsquo;s history in the meantime, is shortly told. Lord Moira,
      despairing of effecting any good by the intended descent on Brittany,
      changed the direction of his force, landed at Ostend, and finally joined
      the Duke of York at Mechlin. In my father&rsquo;s regiment, the lieut.-colonel
      had become sick, and the senior major retired&mdash;consequently the
      command had devolved upon himself&mdash;and could any thing have
      reconciled the severance of young love, it would have been the early
      prospect of military distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major O&rsquo;Halloran proved that fortune had not vainly offered him her
      favours. His regiment was brigaded with the rear-guard, and on every
      occasion the battalion was admirably commanded. The service of retiring
      constantly in front of a victorious army is most discouraging, but still
      that disheartening duty was performed with a spirit deserving better
      fortune. At last the Duke of York was recalled, and for a time his
      successor, Count Walmoden, assumed the offensive. An attack on the
      Republicans at Tuy had partial success, and my father heading the
      grenadier company, carried the town by assault. With that exploit his
      military career was prematurely closed&mdash;his left arm was fractured by
      a grape shot, amputated afterwards, and he returned to England invalided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest is briefly told. He found himself a father, and his own sire had
      paid the debt of nature. His health was shaken by fatigue, his wound
      healed slowly, and after some consideration, he retired from the army upon
      half pay, obtaining a colonel&rsquo;s rank and pension, and fixed his residence
      in his native country, taking possession of an ancient house, and what
      proved afterwards an unquiet home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests who on the anniversary of my birth had honoured Knockloftie
      with their presence, were different both in character and appearance. The
      priest was a strong-built, good-humoured, under-sized man, of jovial
      habits and easy disposition, careless how matters went, and consequently,
      ill-adapted to repress the turbulence of a disobedient flock, who would
      have required the religious coercion of a sterner monitor. As confessor to
      the establishment, Father Dominic Kelly made Knockloftie his abiding
      place. He was of gentle blood himself, and preferred being domiciled in
      the house of a gentleman, to a wandering life among the rude dwellings of
      a lawless community. Hence Father Dominic was by no means popular&mdash;and
      his influence over a wild and rebellious people was far less extensive
      than that which is generally possessed by the Irish priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other churchman formed a singular contrast to the burly priest. He was
      a small, attenuated, intelligent-looking personage, possessing natural
      courage and a restless and irascible disposition. A fellow of the
      university, he had retired upon a college living&mdash;and having
      obtained, unhappily for himself, a commission of the peace, he exercised
      his powers with greater zeal than discretion; in short, he had made
      himself so obnoxious to the peasantry that his life was not worth a pin&rsquo;s
      fee. Like Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran, he too was doomed to death, and in the <i>black
      list</i> his name was second to that of my father. A few nights before,
      his glebe-house had been burnt to the ground; and, having escaped
      assassination by a miracle, he found that protection at Knockloftie,
      which, from a more timid proprietor, might have been sought and asked in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were others besides Doctor Hamilton, who during this reign of
      terror had been obliged to abandon their own homes, and elsewhere seek a
      shelter. Several of the poorer farmers had given testimony in recent
      prosecutions which led to the conviction of an assassin, on whom the
      extreme penalty of the law had been justly executed. This in the eyes of
      his guilty companions was a crime beyond the pale of mercy, and the
      unfortunate men were accordingly denounced. They fled for protection to
      Knockloftie&mdash;there, they were now residing&mdash;and, as if the
      measure of my father&rsquo;s offendings was not already full, the daring act of
      interposing between a lawless confederacy and its victims had heaped it
      even to an overflow. No wonder therefore, that the full fury of rebel
      vengeance was to be turned against himself and all whom his roof-tree
      covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, William,&rdquo; said my mother, as she renewed a conversation which had
      been accidentally interrupted, &ldquo;when you were struck down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My foster brother sprang from the ranks, threw away his musket, lifted me
      lightly as even with this lone arm I would lift you, and carried me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In safety from the danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, love&mdash;we had to pass through a cross fire of musketry&mdash;a
      ball struck him, and when he fell dead&mdash;I was in his arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would,&rdquo; said my mother with a sigh, &ldquo;that our Hector had a foster
      brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that he had! and one so faithful and devoted!&rdquo;&mdash;my father drew
      his hand across his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;this is too womanly, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking, the mastiff chained in a kennel beside the hall door
      began to growl, and the priest rose and peeped cautiously through a
      shot-hole in the shutters, to ascertain what might have disturbed the dog.
      Nothing to cause alarm was visible&mdash;and the churchman returned to the
      table, observing, that the night froze keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother had dropped her knitting on the carpet.&mdash;&ldquo;What a horrid
      state of things,&rdquo; observed the lady, as she picked the worsted from the
      floor, &ldquo;that a growl from Cæsar sets my heart beating for an hour, and a
      knock after dark terrifies me almost to death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou a soldier&rsquo;s wife, and play the coward!&rdquo; exclaimed my father. &ldquo;Fear
      nothing, Emily; the old tower from roof to basement is secured&mdash;there
      is not a cranny that would admit the cat that I have not under a flanking
      fire&mdash;the lower windows save one are built up&mdash;I have retrenched
      the hall with a barricade, nailed up the back door, and the front one is
      enfiladed by that embrasure,&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to a window in an angle
      of the room, at either side of which a blunderbuss was standing ready for
      instant use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that for one night thou and the baby were safe within the convent
      walls! then let the scoundrels come! By Heaven! next morning there should
      be more shirts * upon the lawn than were ever spread upon the bleaching
      ground, and the coroner should have occupation, not by single files, but
      by the cart-load.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *   The <i>Defenders</i> wore shirts over their clothes at night,
     and hence were also called <i>White-boys</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      While my father spoke, the whole scene was passing in his &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo;
       and <i>Defenders</i> were dropping by the dozen. His face lighted up, and
      springing from the chair he waved his solitary arm, strode across the
      chamber, and looked with conscious pride at all his military preparations.
      My mother grew pale as death, and turning her eyes up she fervently
      ejaculated, &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; and crossed herself devoutly. The priest
      performed a similar ceremony, and uttered a sincere &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said my father, as he passed his arm round my mother&rsquo;s waist and
      kissed her tenderly; &ldquo;do not alarm yourself. This house is strong; nothing
      but treachery could force it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of that,&rdquo; said the parson; &ldquo;for that I feared and proved. I was
      betrayed by the villain who ate my bread, and saved providentially by the
      babbling folly of an idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said my mother, with an inquiring glance, as she laid her
      knitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tale is briefly told,&rdquo; said Doctor Hamilton. &ldquo;For some time past I
      suspected that my servants were disaffected. I watched them closely, and
      circumstances convinced me that my fears were true. I had business in the
      next town; my tithe agent dared not venture out of doors, and it was
      imperatively necessary that I should see him. By a lane, the distance
      between the glebe-house and the village was only four miles&mdash;all I
      wanted done would occupy but a few minutes&mdash;and I took, as I
      supposed, effectual means to enable me to accomplish the object I had in
      view, and return home even before my absence was known in my treacherous
      household. At dusk I despatched my servant with a letter to the curate,
      and when he was out of sight I saddled a fast horse, quitted the stable by
      a back door, and rode off at speed for the village. I was unexpectedly
      delayed&mdash;but as a precaution against danger, returned by another and
      longer road. Night had set in; I passed through the last hamlet at a sharp
      trot, and, but a mile from home, pulled up at a steep hill that leads
      directly to the bridge. A lad who was running in an opposite direction
      stopped when he observed me coming, and I recognised him at once to be an
      idiot boy who occasionally visited the glebe-house, where he always
      received meat or money by my orders. As I came closer he began dancing and
      gabbling in a sing-song tune, &ldquo;Ha, ha! Hamilton, ha, ha! somebody will get
      his fairin. There&rsquo;s Dick Brady and the smith behind the hedge, and Jack
      Coyne, and Patsy Gallagher, and twenty more besides, only I don&rsquo;t know
      them with their white shirts and black faces. Ha, ha! ha, ha! somebody
      to-night will get his fairin!&rdquo; He repeated this rhyme, and kept dancing
      for a few moments with idiot glee, and then, under a sudden impulse, ran
      off towards the hamlet which I had but just passed through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again an angry growling was heard from the mastiff&rsquo;s kennel, and the
      priest looked a second time through the shot-hole. The night was clear and
      star-lit, but nothing was visible from the window. Father Dominic resumed
      his seat, and Doctor Hamilton thus continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My danger was imminent, and my resolution must be prompt. I dismounted,
      turned my horse loose, and as I had expected, he galloped off directly
      towards his stable. I sprang into the next field, and lay down under cover
      of the hedge, to consider what was the best direction that I should take
      to escape the blood-hounds, who doubtlessly would be soon upon my trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not been above a minute in concealment when footsteps were heard
      approaching rapidly from the bridge. Two men came on at speed, and one had
      outstripped the other. &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried the hindmost, &lsquo;what a devil of a
      hurry you are in! I can&rsquo;t keep up with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want to be in at the death,&rsquo; returned the well-known voice of my
      villain servant; &lsquo;I would not miss it for a ten-pound note. He thought to
      give me the slip&mdash;put me on a wrong scent, and sent me with a letter.
      He asked me a question about bridling a horse, and that betrayed his
      secret. I knew there was something in the wind&mdash;doubled back upon the
      house after he thought me clear away&mdash;saw him go off through the back
      lane in a canter, and&mdash;&rsquo; Two shots were heard in quick succession.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s down, by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; he exclaimed, with savage
      exultation. &lsquo;Run Murtaugh! they&rsquo;ll be into the house in no time. I know
      where the money is. Run&mdash;the devil&rsquo;s luck to you! and off both
      ruffians started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest you know. Speedily a glare of red light was seen, and a burning
      house&mdash;my own&mdash;guided my flight, for I took the opposite
      direction. I know not whether I was pursued&mdash;but, if I was the
      villains were unsuccessful. At midnight I reached this place of refuge,
      and here, for a time at least, I am safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boundless treachery!&rdquo; exclaimed my father, as the parson ended the
      narrative of his escape. &ldquo;We may set an open enemy at defiance, but who
      can guard against secret villany? By Heaven! a dark suspicion at this
      moment flashes across my mind. Have you noticed the servant who waits at
      table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;and as a disciple of Lavater I denounce him; he never looks
      you fairly in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet the only vulnerable point in the garrison is at that fellow&rsquo;s
      mercy. When I closed up every aperture besides, Hackett remonstrated so
      strongly, and pleaded the inconvenience it would cause should I build up
      the window of his pantry, that I consented to leave it open, merely adding
      a second shutter for security. It is but small&mdash;a man however could
      creep through it&mdash;but to-morrow the mason shall brick it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be fancy,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;but Hackett&rsquo;s manner appears lately to
      have undergone a change. There is at times a freedom in his language that
      borders upon insolence; but hush! here comes the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened as she spoke, and I was added to the company. My mother
      placed me on her knee,&mdash;the parson proposed my health, Father Dominie
      added a supplication, that &ldquo;God would make me a better man than my father,
      and, above all things, keep me out of convents,&rdquo;&mdash;and the latter
      responded an amen. Every glass was emptied to the bottom&mdash;the host
      rang for more wine and the priest replenished his tumbler. It was a moment
      of hilarity, joyous and brief. Suddenly Cæsar gave the alarm&mdash;not as
      before, in under growls, but in the &ldquo;full-mouthed diapason&rdquo; of a bark
      audible a mile oft. The greyhound and the terrier sprang up and answered,&mdash;I
      cried, frightened by the &ldquo;loud alarum,&rdquo;&mdash;the nursemaid caught me from
      my mother, and hurried from the room,&mdash;while my father, exclaiming &ldquo;a
      true challenge, by Heaven!&rdquo;&rsquo; leaped from his chair, and placed himself
      before the wicket that looked upon the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute&mdash;an anxious minute, elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear.&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;the footsteps of a mob, as they tread upon the
      frozen gravel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied, my father, as he turned his ear attentively in the
      direction whence the noise proceeded; &ldquo;that is not the movement of a mob&mdash;they
      step too well together. Soldiers on march, for a hundred!&rdquo; At the
      Colonel&rsquo;s observation, my mother, who had nearly fainted, gradually
      recovered courage, and left the apartment for the nursery to re-establish
      mine,&mdash;my father remained at his post, to ascertain what the party
      were, who at this late hour approached his fortilage,&mdash;while Father
      Dominic ejaculating a pious &ldquo;Heaven stand between us and evil!&rdquo; turned
      down his tumbler to the bottom. Well, it was only his third one, after
      all.

      &ldquo;the heavy tread of marching men&rdquo; ceased, as a party of ten or twelve
      soldiers halted immediately in front of my father&rsquo;s barricade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand! who goes there?&rdquo; was demanded from the loop-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; replied a voice, redolent of the richness of the Shannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance, friend, and give the countersign,&rdquo; returned my father, whose
      phraseology, from military habitude, still retained the parlance of the
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countersign!&rdquo; responded the leader of the belated wayfarers; &ldquo;devil a

      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded my father.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by Jakers, you&rsquo;ll hardly mind me, Colonel;&mdash;Private Phil Brady
      of &lsquo;number eight&rsquo; when you had the regiment; but now, glory be to God and
      good conduct, lance-sergeant in &lsquo;number five.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your party, Brady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my conscience, Colonel, a quare one, enough; tin invalids, a dyin
      woman, ami a fine man-child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unclose the door, Father Dominie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest lifted a heavy key from the side-board, and proceeded to give
      admission to the travellers, when Hackett, who had been hitherto an
      anxious listener, ventured a remonstrance. &ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;give them
      meat and whisky before the door? Every room was already crowded with idle
      people, whom nobody would have harmed, had they remained where they ought,&mdash;at
      home. If the house was to be turned into an hospital for sick trampers and
      their trulls, why every servant would quit a place liker a jail than a
      gentleman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran preserved an ominous tranquillity; and Hackett,
      mistaking the cause, became more insolent as his speech proceeded without
      interruption. But the storm burst at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; said my father in a voice which induced the chief butler to
      recede some paces backwards,&mdash;&ldquo;dare you, a menial, prescribe to me,
      your master, who shall be received and who rejected? Tell me that a
      comrade shall be turned from my door, and recommend that the weary soldier
      be ejected from the house of him under whom he has fought and bled! Off&mdash;we
      part to-morrow. The roof of Knockloftie shall never cover for a second
      night a sneaking scoundrel who has neither welcome for a brave man nor
      pity for a helpless woman;&mdash;show in the sergeant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without venturing to reply, Hackett shrank from the presence of his angry
      master; and in another minute sergeant Philip Brady made his military
      salaam, and, with a capacious bundle in his arms, stood full front before
      his former commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; said the Colonel, as he examined the soldier&rsquo;s outer man, &ldquo;if I
      judge rightly, thou like myself art but lightly indebted to the Low
      Countries and my father held up an empty sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks! and ye may say that, Colonel,&rdquo; replied the sergeant. &ldquo;All that I
      have gained in Holland&mdash;barrin the stripes&mdash;is a slashed cheek,
      a threadbare jacket, and a fine child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kit, however, seems extensive, Phil; that which you carry looks to
      be a well-filled bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the child, your honor; the night was cold, the mother wake, so
      I wrapped the baby in this ould coat, and for its father&rsquo;s sake kept it,
      the cratur, as snug as could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your own, then?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Divil a wife or child has Philip Brady,&rdquo; returned the honest sergeant.
      &ldquo;Ye may remember corporal O&rsquo;Toole,&mdash;he was one of the finest men in
      the grenadiers, when your honor had the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; a better or braver soldier was not in the regiment. What
      became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died at sea, God rest his sowl! on the second day after we left
      Ostend. He was badly wounded when put on board, poor fellow! and we were
      all, men and women, bundled into the transport like so many hounds, short
      of water and provisions, and in the hurry they forgot the surgeon too.
      Well, his wound mortified: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m oft, Phil;&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll not forget
      the poor wife, for my sake, and may God look down upon the orphan! Give me
      your hand upon it, Phil,&rsquo; says he, and he squeezed mine with all his
      feeble strength. When I came down again, his wife was hanging over the
      dead body. They coaxed her away to see the child, and when she returned to
      have some comfort in crying over the corpse, it was already overboard with
      two others, who had dropped off the hooks that evening. From that hour
      Toole&rsquo;s wife (we called him Toole for shortness) has pined away, and the
      life was barely in her when your honor, may God reward ye! let us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why were you so late upon the road?&rdquo; inquired the Colonel; &ldquo;in the
      present state of things soldiers are no favourites, and the chances are
      considerable, had you proceeded farther, that you would have been waylaid
      and abused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks! and I believe your honor. We were delayed partly by accident, and
      partly through design. Our car broke down, the horse lost a shoe, and the
      rest of the party pushed forward, laving us at a forge to get the cart
      mended, and the baste shod. The smith&mdash;divil&rsquo;s luck to him, the
      ruffin!&mdash;kept us three hours, I think on purpose, and then they
      directed us astray. So when I found the night falling, and the poor woman
      all but dead, as I heard there was a gentleman&rsquo;s not far off, I heads the
      party here on chance, little dreaming, the Lord knows, that I had the luck
      of thousands and was coming to my ould Colonel&rsquo;s, and no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father was a man of prompt action and few words. The bell was rung, the
      soldiers sent to the kitchen to refresh themselves, the child committed to
      the care of a female domestic, and carried to the apartment whither its
      dying mother had been previously removed. There, my mother and the
      woman-kind of the establishment used every means which simple skill
      suggested; but already the decree had gone forth, and within an hour after
      the arrival of the party the crisis came, the widow of the dead soldier
      was at rest, and her babe an orphan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The struggle was brief,&rdquo; said the priest, as he re-entered the room, from
      which he had been so hastily summoned
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;By a dying woman to pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      May God receive her in mercy! She went off so gently, that though we were
      all about the bed, no one could tell the moment when she departed. My lady
      is crying over her as if she were a sister, and the baby sleeping soundly
      in Sibby Connor&rsquo;s arms, as if it were still resting on that bosom which
      had been designed by God to be its pillow and support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father, as was his wont when any thing particularly excited him, sprang
      from his chair, and strode thrice across the chamber.&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me not,&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, &ldquo;that there is not an especial providence over every thing&mdash;ay,
      from the sparrow to the soldier&rsquo;s child. That orphan has been sent to <i>me</i>,&mdash;mine
      it is,&mdash;mine it shall be. Pass the wine, Doctor. Here comes <i>madame</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My mother timidly approached the side of her husband&rsquo;s chair, and laid her
      hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you be very angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry, love!&rdquo; replied my father, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never were angry with me yet. But&mdash;but&mdash;I have done
      something, upon which I should have previously obtained your sanction,
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Emily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;the dying woman, that her helpless child
      should find in you and me protectors. Hector&rsquo;s nurse has taken the orphan,&mdash;and
      shall he not be our own boy&rsquo;s foster-brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, my dear, precisely what I had determined to have done myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the sufferer&rsquo;s voice failed totally,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;she
      said that the child was still unchristened, and prayed that rite might be
      performed when convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no difficulty in complying with her request,&rdquo; replied my
      father; &ldquo;there are now two learned Thebans in Knockloftie. To which of the
      professors does the poor baby belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His parents were Roman Catholics,&rdquo; said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Father Dominic, a cast of your office will be necessary. Ring for
      Sergeant Brady&mdash;and then parade the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the non-commissioned officer and the soldier&rsquo;s orphan
      were introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name shall I give him?&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; rejoined the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Marc,&rdquo; observed the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; said Dr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than one would suppose, Doctor,&rdquo; replied my father. &ldquo;Our red-headed
      adjutant married a Bath heiress almost at sight, for after but a two
      hours&rsquo; siege she surrendered at discretion, declaring that it was utterly
      impossible to hold out against a lover whose appellatives were Julius
      Cæsar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then add Antony to his patronymic, and your <i>protégé</i> will prove
      irresistible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marc Antony be it then,&rdquo; replied the priest; and in five minutes the
      ceremony was complete. The sergeant retired to finish his supper below
      stairs, and the orphan was returned to the nursery, named after that
      amorous Roman, who &ldquo;for a queen of fifty&rdquo; gave up a world.

      The clock struck eleven.&mdash;My mother retired for the night, and the
      priest had been called out to prescribe for a sick soldier,&mdash;for his
      reverence united leechcraft to divinity, and thus was doubly useful. My
      father and Dr. Hamilton were consequently left alone, and both for some
      minutes had been communing with their own thoughts&mdash;my father broke
      the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not wherefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but something whispers me that this
      night is fated to be an important one in the history of the old house. I&rsquo;m
      not inclined for sleep, and I feel a sort of restlessness, as if the day&rsquo;s
      events had not yet closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the mental reaction which follows some unusual excitement, replied
      the divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; returned my father. &ldquo;On with more wood. We&rsquo;ll order a
      light supper, and borrow an hour from the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor threw some billets on the fire, while my father filled his
      glass, and transferred the wine duly to the churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you remark the opposition which Hackett made when I gave orders to
      admit the soldiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched him attentively,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;His lips grew pale, his
      brows lowered, and with great difficulty he suppressed a burst of angry
      feelings which seemed almost too strong to be controlled. Be assured, my
      dear Colonel, that man is dangerous. If he be not traitor, I wrong him
      sorely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;the dog is growling. What! more late visitors?
      This is indeed a busy night; and again honest Cæsar proves himself a
      worthy sentinel. Wherever treachery may lurk, there&rsquo;s none within his
      kennel, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel reconnoitred from his embrasure, but there was nothing to
      excite alarm. The moon had risen, and the sky, spangled with frost-stars,
      was bright and clear. Cæsar, advanced to the full length of his chain, was
      patted upon the head by a person closely wrapped up, who spoke to him with
      the admitted familiarity of an old acquaintance. To the Colonel&rsquo;s demand
      of name and business, a female voice replied, &ldquo;I beg your honour&rsquo;s pardon,
      it&rsquo;s me, Mary Halligan. My mother-in-law won&rsquo;t put over the night. She
      wants to see his reverence in private, and sent me with some lines * to
      the priest. None of the boys would venture to the Castle after dark, for
      fear of Cæsar and your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The term &ldquo;lines&rdquo; is generally used by the Irish peasantry
     instead of &ldquo;letter.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary, late as it is, we&rsquo;ll allow you in. Will you, Hamilton, unlock
      the door, and let us have the lady <i>here</i>&mdash;for <i>entre nous</i>,
      she belongs to a faithless family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant now in waiting at the hall-door was decidedly the handsomest
      woman in the parish. For time immemorial her fathers had been servants in
      Knockloftie, and she an occasional inmate of the house. Her brother,
      educated by my grandfather, had discharged the double duty of schoolmaster
      and driver&mdash;the latter, in plain English, meaning the factotum of an
      Irish gentleman of small estate. In this department, Halligan had been
      found dishonest, was disgracefully turned off, joined lawless men,
      obtained among them a bad pre-eminence, and now, under the double ban of
      murder and sedition, was skulking in the hills with a reward of fifty
      pounds offered for his apprehension. After her brother&rsquo;s disgrace, Mary
      had seldom visited the mansion of her former master&mdash;and, as report
      said, she was affianced to one of the most troublesome and disaffected
      scoundrels in the barony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan, and much against her own inclination, was inducted by the
      churchman into my father&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;It was too much trouble to his
      honour,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;Mr. Hackett the butler would do all she wanted,
      and give the lines to Father Dominic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said my father, as he handed her a glass of wine, &ldquo;you tremble.
      Has anything alarmed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very, very cold, your honour, out of doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold it is, certainly, and Father Dominic will have a dreary ride. &lsquo;Where
      is the letter for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan&rsquo;s colour went and came, for my father&rsquo;s searching eye was
      turned upon her, and that added to her confusion. She-fumbled in her bosom&mdash;pulled
      out one paper,&mdash;a second fell upon the carpet&mdash;one she caught up&mdash;the
      other she hastily delivered&mdash;and the latter, was the wrong one.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father carelessly looked over it, while Mary Halligan scrutinized his
      face with deep attention. As he read it&mdash;she became pale as death,
      and seemed hanging in fearful expectation upon the first words that
      Colonel O&rsquo;llalloran would litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said my father carelessly, &ldquo;so the old woman&rsquo;s bad it seems. She
      wants, I suppose, to make her will&mdash;leave you an heiress, Mary,&mdash;and
      Father Dominic will assist her. Well, the priest will be here directly.
      Come, Mary, &lsquo;for auld lang syne&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have a glass. What has become of
      your brother, the schoolmaster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God forgive the liars! They slandered him, and turned your honour
      again him. He would die for a dog belonging to Knockloftie,&mdash;and if
      he didn&rsquo;t, the bigger villain he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the young miller, Mary? people say you are about to marry him. Is he
      slandered, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God sees he is,&rdquo; was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any nightly meetings at the chapel, Mary?&rdquo; said the Colonel. The girl
      changed colour again: &ldquo;None, your honour&mdash;not one. Thanks be to God!
      the bad people have left the parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see your brother? To-night?&rdquo; said the Colonel sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; returned the girl, in tones which indicated deep confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am jesting, Mary. Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Connaught, your honour, with a cousin of my mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There let him remain, Mary. There, he will be safe until things become
      more quiet. But, Mary, the times are not as they were five years ago, when
      you and I used to meet by moonlight near the <i>bouilee</i>. * Pshaw!
      don&rsquo;t blush;&mdash;it was only to gather bilberries, and exchange kisses
      for new ribbons. Did you come here alone?&mdash;no lover&mdash;no comrade&mdash;none
      to bear you company?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *   The mountain bivouac of the peasant girls, where during
     the summer months they attend to the cattle which are then
     driven to the hills.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put my trust in God,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and then, Colonel, you know I was
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as we used to do in Glencullen. Ah, Mary, would that all young women
      had your prudence and religion, and poor Father Dominic would not be
      broken-hearted as he is, in fulminating vengeance against broken vows and
      repairing damaged reputations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding my father&rsquo;s <i>badinage</i> Mary Halligan seemed ill at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plase you honour, I would wish to be going,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and as Father
      Dominic is not in the way, I would like to say a word or two to Mr.
      Hackett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, certainly; but, Mary, will you not stop, and see your mistress?
      Doctor, I must trespass on you to ask my wife to come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parson left the room, and speedily returned with my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, Emily, is an old acquaintance. Not a word, Mary, about bilberries
      or the bouillee. Bring her to the nursery, my love&mdash;and,&rdquo; he added in
      a suppressed voice, &ldquo;be sure you keep her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed, my father handed the letter he had received from the
      peasant-girl to the parson, and as the latter read it he became red and
      pale alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how could you with this murderous missive in
      your hand talk lightly with its bearer, and jest with that fiend in
      woman&rsquo;s form, who brought an order that doomed to death or outrage all
      that your roof-tree covers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied my father coolly, &ldquo;it furnished me with a glorious
      counterstroke. I threw my eye but hastily over it&mdash;read me that
      precious document!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the paper was remarkable. At the top, a scull and
      cross-bones were rudely stamped, and though the handwriting was tolerable,
      the sentences were ungrammatical, and many of the words misspelt. The
      letter ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made two attempts to send you information, but your d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      master, like bad fortune, was always in the way; my sister Mary will
      strive to hand you this. To-night our fate must be decided, for Luke Byrn,
      Cooney, and your brother are betrayed, and at sunrise to-morrow, if there
      be a living man in Knockloftie, they&rsquo;re all dead men; the witnesses are to
      be removed to Donegal, and if they once reach it, Cooney will split, and
      you and I are certain of the gallows. At <i>one o&rsquo;clock</i> I&rsquo;ll be with
      you; lave the window open, and I&rsquo;ll show the boys the way in, as I know
      the house, and the smith has keys that will open the yard gate. Once when
      four or five of us gets in, we&rsquo;ll open the hall door for the remainder;
      you can finish the master easily when he hears the first alarm and rushes
      from his room; the rest will be child&rsquo;s play, and then <i>no quarter</i>.
      The black seal is to this paper; mind, Hackett, you&rsquo;re to watch the
      Colonel&rsquo;s door, and I&rsquo;ll be first man through the window. No more at
      present, from your friend and commander,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Halligan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s a postscript,&rdquo; and the parson turned the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When the job&rsquo;s over we&rsquo;ll have a roaring night. As, captain, you know
      the Colonel&rsquo;s lady&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo; He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read on!&rdquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;mere ribald nonsense,&rdquo; returned the churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran snatched the letter from his hand, and in one glance
      his eye passed over the portion of the paper which had been previously
      overlooked. To the <i>expose</i> of Halligan&rsquo;s murderous intentions my
      father had listened with cold and contemptuous indifference: but when he
      read the postscript, a terrible change came over his countenance, and
      succeeded its previous expression of calm defiance. The eye flashed, the
      brow contracted, and springing from his chair the Colonel paced the room,
      muttering something between his clenched teeth which was but partially
      overheard. The outbreak of his passion was however as momentary as it had
      been strong,&mdash;and in a minute he resumed his seat, and calmly
      addressed the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said my father as he looked at the clock on the mantel, &ldquo;an
      hour and twenty minutes to put our house in order, and a tenth portion of
      the time would be sufficient. You shall be aide-de-camp, Hamilton,&mdash;and
      to Father Dominic we&rsquo;ll entrust the management of the women, and make his
      reverence keep matters quiet and administer ghostly consolation until the
      squall blows over. Mr. Hackett must be secured, but Heaven forbid the
      honest hangman should be anticipated! Cut down that bell-rope&mdash;now
      pull the other one&mdash;and then sit down and fill, Doctor,&mdash;ay,
      fill high, Confusion to all traitors! and here comes a most superlative
      scoundrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler had promptly answered the summons of the bell. &ldquo;Bring
      slippers,&rdquo; said the Colonel, and the order was obeyed. Kneeling he removed
      his master&rsquo;s boots, placed the slippers on his feet, and was about to
      rise, when to his astonishment my father&rsquo;s powerful arm prevented it, and
      in a minute more he was bound hand and foot, and flung upon the floor in
      perfect helplessness, with an intimation &ldquo;deep not loud&rdquo; that the first
      movement he attempted of limb or tongue would prove a certain passport to
      eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hurry or alarm the effective strength of my father&rsquo;s garrison was
      speedily assembled in the great parlour, and sixteen men were found fit
      for duty in Knockloftie&mdash;a number more than sufficient for its
      defence. To all, arms and cartridges were delivered,&mdash;and every
      musket was carefully loaded to ensure a certain and effective fire when
      the moment of action should arrive. My father&rsquo;s orders were brief, clear,
      and easily comprehended&mdash;and as every spot of vantage had been
      occupied, every window that looked upon the front or back approaches had
      one or more marksmen assigned for its defence according to its local
      importance. The lights were blinded, the strictest silence was enjoined,
      and not a trigger was to be drawn until my father gave the signal. Never
      was a small garrison better prepared or more determined; the soldiers,
      under a belief that they had been specially betrayed, and that they would
      have been assailed if their route had been continued, were burning to be
      revenged upon their intended murderers; while those who had found shelter
      from their enemies in Knockloftie, already doomed men, knew also that they
      were the chief objects of attack, and that no alternative remained to them
      but to defeat it or&rsquo; to perish. Thus circumstanced, Knockloftie had little
      to fear from open force. True, treachery or surprise might possibly have
      succeeded. Against the former, if there were faith in a stout bell-rope
      and a parson&rsquo;s knot, the old house for the present was secure; and from
      the latter, the <i>mal adresse</i> of Miss Halligan had effectually
      preserved the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all his preparations were completed, my father ascended to the upper
      story of the tower to satisfy himself that his wife and infant were in
      safety. On opening the door the chamber presented a sad and striking
      scene. On one bed, the corpse of the soldier&rsquo;s widow was &ldquo;laid out,&rdquo;
       attired in the simple habiliments of the grave used by the Irish
      peasantry; and in another, two children were sleeping side by side,
      unconscious that murder and rapine were abroad, and that guilty steps were
      moving to this their abode of peace. My mother, bending over both, was
      murmuring a prayer for their deliverance, while, by the feeble light of a
      waxen taper, the priest, in a low and monotonous voice, was reading an
      office for the dead. One other person was there&mdash;a worthless woman.
      Mary Halligan sat before the fire; she neither spoke nor moved, but with
      her eyes fixed upon the dying embers, in full conviction that her
      treachery was suspeeted or discovered, she quailed before my father&rsquo;s
      glance, and, while he remained in the apartment, never ventured to look
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel&rsquo;s visit was short: he whispered in his wife&rsquo;s ear assurances
      of safety, and affectionately kissed her and the infant; then turning a
      withering glance upon his former mistress, he left the chamber and joined
      the men below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock chimed three-quarters&mdash;no sound was heard that possibly
      could cause alarm, nor was there a growl from the kennel of the dog&mdash;and
      yet the murderers were at hand unchallenged. No wonder&mdash;Hector was in
      the agonies of death&mdash;Curses light upon the traitress! Mary Halligan,
      while she patted his honest head, had poisoned him!

      away, my father took a pistol from the table, placed another in his
      breast, and beckoned the soldier whom he had previously selected to attend
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest Philip,&rdquo; said he, addressing the non-commissioned officer, &ldquo;keep
      the lads cool, and wait till you hear my signal. You may expect a rush in
      front&mdash;don&rsquo;t let that alarm you, the door will defy every effort to
      break it down. Aim steadily&mdash;one well-directed shot is worth a dozen
      random ones. I shall have the honour of receiving Mr. Hackett&rsquo;s friends at
      the pantry-window, and leave them, I trust, no reason to complain that
      their reception was not warm enough. Should that scoundrel move,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to the prostrate menial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be his last movement in this world,&rdquo; returned Sergeant Brady.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pin him with a bayonet to the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the pantry-window been secured?&rdquo; inquired the divine. &ldquo;If it has,&rdquo;
       replied my father, &ldquo;bolt and bar shall be withdrawn, and the aperture
      stand invitingly open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Doctor Hamilton, &ldquo;to give entrance to a band of murderers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; returned my father with stern composure, &ldquo;to stop it with the
      carcase of their leader. And now, my lads, be steady&mdash;a golden guinea
      for every white-shirt on the lawn at sun-rise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Colonel quitted the apartment, and, accompanied by the
      attendant, proceeded to the post of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the soldier in the passage as a support, my father entered the
      pantry, unclosed the shutters, and placed himself beside the open
      casement. For a determined man, the post was excellently adapted. Himself
      concealed in darkness, all without was visible&mdash;for the moon had
      risen, and although the lofty tower flung its deep shadow across the lower
      buildings over which it domineered, there was still a narrow alley of
      light spanning the court-yard, on which each passing object could not fail
      to be revealed clearly to him who watched within. The time, the
      circumstances, all, to &ldquo;coming events&rdquo; gave an imposing effect. Violence
      was abroad&mdash;and all within prepared for desperate resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes&mdash;long, long, minutes&mdash;passed. Another interval,&mdash;and
      another followed; not a light twinkled in the castle&mdash;not a sound
      fell upon the ear. Suddenly, a key grated in the lock&mdash;a door opened
      in the court-yard; a man appeared&mdash;he stopped&mdash;listened&mdash;advanced&mdash;hesitated&mdash;retired
      again&mdash;and then spoke in soft whispers to some others. There was a
      pause. Once more the stranger issued from the doorway, crossed the moonlit
      vista, and stopped before the pantry-window. He passed his arm through the
      aperture&mdash;drew back again, and muttered with evident satisfaction,&mdash;&ldquo;All
      is right! the window&rsquo;s open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four&mdash;six&mdash;eight&mdash;ten&mdash;twelve!&mdash;all issued into
      moonlight, and grouped themselves around the casement. The leader spoke in
      smothered tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hackett! Pat!&mdash;hush! no reply. All&rsquo;s right; he&rsquo;s at the Colonel&rsquo;s
      door. Hackett!&rdquo;&mdash;another pause&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis safe, and Mary has
      succeeded. I told you I would show you in; and now for vengeance!&rdquo; Ay! and
      vengeance that was to be so easily obtained; for Knockloftie appeared
      buried in the deep repose which ever attends a false security. The leader
      turned, &ldquo;No quarter, boys,&rdquo; jumped into the open casement, and added,
      &ldquo;Mercy to none!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words and action were simultaneous. Halligan had passed his head
      already through the aperture, when a voice, like an echo, responded in
      deeper tones &ldquo;Mercy to none!&rdquo;&mdash;A pistol exploded&mdash;and the robber
      chief dropped heavily from the window, a dead man!
    </p>
    <p>
      To all, the assailants and the assailed, that fatal shot proved the
      signal. The expected assault was made upon the front, the more daring of
      the party rushing on with sledge-hammers to try and force an entrance&mdash;but
      not a stroke fell upon the door. From every aperture a withering
      cross-fire was opened. It was returned by a random volley, which
      splintered the windows, but inflicted no loss upon those within, who were
      already carefully protected. In the rear of the building, a still bloodier
      repulse attended the night attack while their leader reconnoitred, the
      ruffian group behind had been covered by a dozen muskets, and within a few
      moments after the robber&rsquo;s fall, half his companions formed a lifeless
      heap upon the pavement.

    <p>
      When my father rushed up stairs, the struggle in front was over. Dead and
      dying men were extended before the door&mdash;and in the clear moonlight
      those who escaped the fire from the house, were seen flying in wild
      disorder. As in lawless efforts generally, numbers had only produced
      embarrassment, and rendered failure more fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance satisfied my father that the attempt had been fearfully
      repulsed; and he hastened to the sad but safe asylum, where those most
      dear to him had been placed for their security. My mother and the children
      had been already removed by the priest and servants to their respective
      chambers&mdash;and Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran, with a dead and living woman, was
      left in possession of the melancholy apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan was seated as when my father had quitted the room; her eyes
      were fixed upon the wood-fire&mdash;a minute passed&mdash;and not a word
      was uttered. My father laid his hand upon her shoulder, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;treachery! and from you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore not?&rdquo; exclaimed the peasant girl, as she sprang upon her
      feet, and boldly returned his glance. &ldquo;Why should not the deceived in turn
      become deceiver&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched woman! even had I wronged you, would you wreak vengeance on
      those who never wished you evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time, Mary, when you would not have betrayed the doomed one
      to the destroyer, and that victim&mdash;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan was deeply affected; she sobbed, and tears, like raindrops,
      fell fast upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And could a few brief years change that once gentle nature, and so
      fearfully? Would nothing satisfy revenge, but death for me&mdash;insult
      for my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death&mdash;insult!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Neither was intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read&mdash;&lsquo;tis the paper you gave me by mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan cast her eyes upon the scroll; her lips and checks grew
      pale; her hand shook violently; the paper dropped upon the floor; and
      turning her eyes upwards, she exclaimed, &ldquo;As I was unconscious that such
      villany was designed, so may Heaven grant me pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save my uncle from the gallows. They told me that witnesses who must
      convict him and others were sheltered in this house; and that could they
      but be carried off and concealed until after the assizes, then the
      prisoners&rsquo; lives were safe. They stated that they only wanted the arms
      deposited in Knockloftie;&mdash;that they would swear you to quit the
      country&mdash;and thus intimidate those who had followed your example and
      ventured to remain. Before I consented to carry the letter which my
      brother wished to have conveyed to Hackett, he swore upon the chapel-altar
      where the party had collected, that not one hair of your head should
      suffer injury. May God forgive him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that prayer, Mary, I add a sincere amen! He is gone to his account&mdash;a
      perjurer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to his account!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Is he dead? Who killed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fell by the hand of one whom he would have more than murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then am I now indeed alone upon the world!&rdquo; A long and liar-rowing
      silence followed. &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I dare not curse, and cannot bless
      you. Four short years have passed. How bitterly have all things changed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Mary! From my soul, I pity and believe you. You tell me that you
      did not know the purport of this night attack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, I did not. You wrecked my happiness; but still I would not&mdash;could
      not subdue feelings now best forgotten. Forgotten, said I?&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Halligan had spoken to my father in her native tongue; and those who
      are intimate with that portion of the kingdom where the Celtic language is
      still retained, will remember with what poetic imagery, the Irish
      peasantry at times detail their mingled story of grief and joy, wrong and
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was one of those on whom nature stamps the grace which art idly or
      imperfectly can simulate. Her voice had all &ldquo;The sweetness of the
      mountain-tongue and more affecting still, all that it uttered seemed to
      come directly from the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved you, Denis&mdash;ay, loved in all the madness with which woman
      loves. The peasant girl never dreamed that birth and rank had divided us
      immeasurably. She never thought that she should be wooed and won, and cast
      aside for others. She knew nothing of the world. Those, for whom Heaven
      had designed her, sought her, and sued, and were rejected. You came. Six
      years had changed us&mdash;the child had become a girl&mdash;the boy had
      become a man. There was joy and merriment at Knockloftie&mdash;I was your
      chosen partner in the dance&mdash;and you would leave your dogs upon the
      moor, to steal to the bouillee, and sit for hours beside me. Is it to be
      wondered at that I loved with the ardour of a first passion&mdash;and the
      undoubting confidence of woman? While no sound was heard above the rushing
      waterfall, you plucked heath and wild-flowers from the bank, placed them
      in my hair, and swore you would be constant. Fool that I was! I believed
      you,&mdash;hid them in my bosom,&mdash;and before they faded, I found
      myself deserted and betrayed.&rdquo; She paused,&mdash;her agitation was
      fearful; but a flood of tears relieved it, and she thus continued:&mdash;&ldquo;You
      went to another land,&mdash;the sea rolled between us,&mdash;and were you
      forgotten? Oh, no! In fancy, I saw you still upon the moor&mdash;in sleep,
      I sate beside you on the heather&mdash;your name was mingled in my prayers&mdash;and
      when one was offered for my own sins, three were poured warm from the
      heart, to implore a blessing on the absent one. Well, well; the dream is
      over,&mdash;the spell is broken,&mdash;and in this world you and I shall
      never meet again. Farewell, Colonel. There were two beings between whom
      this heart once was shared. I look my last upon the living one&mdash;and,
      too soon, I shall have looked my last upon the dead. I dare not press that
      hand&mdash;there&rsquo;s blood upon it; and&mdash;oh, God! that blood&mdash;a
      brother&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, who had witnessed the termination of this painful interview,
      led Mary Halligan from the room. Her brother&rsquo;s body, with those of the
      other lawless men who had fallen or been wounded in the night affray, were
      already by my father&rsquo;s orders removed to an adjacent village. Presently,
      the sky was overcast, the moon withdrew her light, and a heavy snow shower
      fell for miles around, covering the surface of the ground; and when
      morning dawned no traces of a recent affray were seen, and not a
      blood-stain was visible. One melancholy memorial of foul treachery alone
      remained:&mdash;hidden by a sward of snow, poor Caesar lay before his
      empty kennel; and, true to the last, even in the agonies of death he had
      howled a bold defiance at his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily,&rdquo; said my father, when breakfast was removed, &ldquo;I need not tell you
      that a soldier&rsquo;s wife must always hold herself in readiness to move. Until
      better times arrive, you and the boy must leave this unquiet mansion. Nay,
      start not, love! I shall be your companion. That fading cheek and heavy
      eye bear silent evidence that cannot be mistaken. There is not in this old
      tower a single stone that I do not regard with veneration; but were this
      gloomy pile a palace, and you unhappy, it should be abandoned. I have
      already sent a requisition for an escort, and do you get all you wish to
      be removed in marching order. To society,&mdash;to myself,&mdash;I owed a
      duty; that duty is discharged. A tenderer claim remains. Can I forget,
      dear Emily, that for me you gave up the convent&rsquo;s quiet?&mdash;that for me
      title and wealth were thrown away?&mdash;that for me even the stronger
      ties of kindred were dissolved? Can I forget that though a gentle spirit
      like yours trembles at a life of danger, and recoils from scenes of
      bloodshed, still not a murmur passed your lips?&mdash;not a remonstrance
      urged upon me your apprehensions? Enough;&mdash;a soldier&rsquo;s pride would
      prompt me to remain where we are,&mdash;while a husband&rsquo;s affections
      demand that my wife and child should be placed in full security. The
      struggle is ended, and pride must yield to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the last word was spoken, a happy wife was shedding tears of joy
      upon her husband&rsquo;s bosom. Instant preparations were made; such valuables
      as were portable were packed up; Knockloftie for a time formally
      abandoned; and ere another week elapsed, my mother, my foster-brother and
      myself found ourselves in perfect safety&mdash;and for some months
      succeeding became residents of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first anniversary formed a remarkable epoch in the story of our house;
      and as many subsequent adventures in my humble history were referable to
      that event, I shall briefly narrate the more immediate consequences that
      resulted. Mary Halligan quitted the country, as it was believed, to reside
      with some relatives in the west. Hackett received sentence of death, but
      the extreme penalty of the law was commuted into transportation. Sergeant
      Brady retired on a pension, and became henchman to my father. Mr.
      Hamilton, after Knockloftie was deserted, with a fatal imprudence still
      continued in the neighbourhood. A few weeks afterwards, the house where he
      resided was forced by a numerous banditti, the unfortunate clergyman
      dragged from his concealment, carried to the door, and slaughtered under
      circumstances of fearful barbarity. *

    <p>
      Time passed,&mdash;months slipped away,&mdash;and my mother&rsquo;s birth-day
      returned. That morning, a letter containing a bank-note for five hundred
      pounds was received. It was addressed to the lady&mdash;with a brief
      intimation in an unknown hand, that a similar gift should be annually
      presented. Another brief period passed, and another letter came. It
      brought but sorry news. Knockloftie was burned to the ground;&mdash;not a
      fragment that was combustible remained;&mdash;and what was once &ldquo;a merrie
      hall&rdquo; now frowned upon the ocean in black and ruined loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my father read the letter, a change came over his face, and revealed to
      the inquiring eyes then bent upon it, that evil tidings had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;what is wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, love, but that Knockloftie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is, with all that it contained, a heap of ashes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo;&mdash;and my mother crossed herself,&mdash;&ldquo;are we not
      ruined, Denis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, love; not exactly ruined. I had the vanity to call my abiding
      place &lsquo;a castle.&rsquo; Well, we must change the name; and surely &lsquo;cottage&rsquo; will
      sound as sweetly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I can spare a horse or two,&mdash;part with a dozen dogs,&mdash;and
      then, my love, we will require the fewer servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the carriage,&mdash;what need of it?&rdquo; exclaimed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; possibly if things come to the worst, it too might be
      dispensed with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then my jewels, Denis!&rdquo;&mdash;and my mother&rsquo;s eyes brightened with
      delight&mdash;&ldquo;ay, those useless baubles. I have heard that they are
      precious! They shall be sold, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never&mdash;by Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed my father, as he spurned the chair over
      the carpet, and strode across the room. In another minute his calmness had
      returned, and my mother was sitting on his knee, smiling away with woman&rsquo;s
      tact, every recollection of annoyance; and propounding with the sweetest
      philosophy upon earth, visionary plans for future happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the postman&rsquo;s knock was heard, and another letter was presented. My
      father flung it unopened on the table. &ldquo;Curse the particulars!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;what matters it whether the old roof-tree fell by carelessness
      or villany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My mother impressed a consolatory kiss upon her husband&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, love,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You and I have no secrets, Emily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady broke the seal, and looked at the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Constantine Mac Donough?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very singular old man; a distant relation of my mother. Many years ago,
      my father and he quarrelled at an election. They fought in half an hour,&mdash;left
      the ground after three shots had been discharged,&mdash;and both refused a
      reconciliation. What was the cause of quarrel, I never could discover from
      my father; indeed, I question whether the worthy man himself even knew
      what it was distinctly; and with Mr. Mae Donough, of course, I never had
      even any acquaintance. He lives a bachelor, and report states, that he is
      very wealthy and very eccentric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lived! my love; the old man&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; exclaimed my father. &ldquo;And has left you heir to all his property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel sprang from his chair&mdash;his solitary arm encircled my
      mother&rsquo;s waist, as he pressed her passionately to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when the sad tidings arrived this morning that we were
      houseless, I felt only for the boy and thee. Well, before the same sun
      went down, dove-like you came, the harbinger of happiness. The &lsquo;barren
      heritage&rsquo; I quitted with regret, will be amply replaced by the rich lands
      of Killucan; and, once more, a peaceful home&mdash;such as we had in
      England, love&mdash;is ours. Never despond, Emily&mdash;and even in his
      darkest hour let an Irishman trust to the lady of the wheel&mdash;for I
      verily believe, if there be a spot on earth for which the blind baggage
      has a particular fancy, blessed Saint Patrick! that island is your own.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV. MY ENTRÉE ON THE WORLD.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he residence and
      domain so opportunely bequeathed to Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran, formed a striking
      contrast to his ancient home. Like the domicile of Justice Shallow, every
      thing about Knockloftie might have been described as &ldquo;barren all,&rdquo; with
      the qualification of &ldquo;marry, good air,&rdquo; while Killucan was situated in an
      inland county remarkable for its fertility. The house was a large and
      commodious building, almost concealed by trees, the growth of at least a
      century; the parks were rich and well laid down; comfort was within the
      dwelling,&mdash;plenty without it; and as they say in Connaught, no man
      &ldquo;came into a snugger sitting down&rdquo; than my worthy father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here ten years of boyhood passed away: and here at the feet of that gifted
      Gamaliel, father Dominic, my foster-brother and myself were indoctrinated.
      The priest had borne the departure of my parents with all the resignation
      a Christian man could muster; but as he declared afterwards, the
      destruction of Knockloftie fairly broke his heart. When his patron
      unexpectedly succeeded to a goodly inheritance, it is difficult to decide
      whether to the churchman or the commander, this fortunate event caused the
      greater satisfaction. At the first summons, father Dominic abandoned his
      wild charge, and resumed the official duties in our establishment;&mdash;said
      mass for my mother, confessed the maids, aided and assisted the Colonel in
      the diurnal demolition of three bottles of antiquated port, and
      endeavoured into the bargain, to knock Latin into me, and &ldquo;the fear of
      God,&rdquo; as he called it, into the heart of my foster-brother. How far either
      attempt proved successful, it is not for me to say. As to myself, Dominic
      occasionally declared that I should try the temper of a saint; and as to
      Marc Antony, he rather hoped than expected that he might not &ldquo;spoil a
      market;&rdquo; meaning thereby, that the aforesaid Marc Antony would be hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! from the pupilage of that worthy churchman, Marc and I were
      fated to be delivered. Father Dominic caught fever at the bedside of a
      sick tenant; and to the universal regret of the whole household, he went
      the way which all, priest and levite, are doomed to go. At the time, his
      loss was severely felt, and after-experience did not tend to lessen it.
      Father Grady, who in spiritual matters became his successor, was ill
      fitted to step into poor Dominic&rsquo;s shoes. He was a low-born, illiterate,
      intermeddling priest, of forbidding exterior and repulsive manners. His <i>gaucheries</i>
      disgusted my mother, and my father fired at his vulgar arrogance. Except
      professionally, the visits of the priest became infrequent; and when the
      maids returned from confession with a route made out for the Reek, * they
      would call to memory the gentle penances of father Dominic,&mdash;offer a
      tear as a tribute to his memory,&mdash;and murmur a &ldquo;Heaven be merciful to
      his soul.&rdquo; The first consequence of the death of Father Dominic was my
      being transmitted to the school of Enniskillen, while my foster-brother
      finished his education under the instruction of the village pedagogue. As
      to the latter, a more unpromising disciple never figured on a slate; but,
      to give the devil his due, Marc Antony was even as his enemies allowed,
      the best boxer of his inches in the parish.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  A lofty mountain in the west of Ireland, where Roman
     Catholic penances are performed.
</pre>
    <p>
      How quickly years roll on! Six passed rapidly away.&mdash;I grew fast&mdash;manhood
      came on apace&mdash;every day the thrall of school-discipline became more
      irksome, and made me long to be emancipated. I had indeed sprung up with
      marvellous rapidity, and I looked with impatience to the moment when I
      should make my entrée on the world. Nor was I kept much longer in
      suspense, for a mandate from my father unexpectedly arrived, commanding my
      return to Kilcullen, and acquainting me that I had been gazetted to a
      second lieutenancy in the Twenty-first fusileers. With a joyous heart I
      took leave of my companions; exchanged forgiveness with the ushers; flung
      boyhood to the winds: and, ignorant of the world as an infant, at eighteen
      years, deemed myself in pride of heart a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was singular enough that the day of my return also proved to be the
      anniversary of my birth; and of this I was duly apprized by Sergeant
      Brady, as he unclosed the gate to let me in. Having returned the honest
      squeeze with which the non-commissioned officer bade me welcome, I gave my
      horse to one of the eternal hangers-on whom I overtook lounging slowly
      home from the village tobacco-shop, and passed through a sort of
      pleasure-ground that led directly to the house. Turning the hedge, I came
      suddenly on Susan, my mother&rsquo;s maid. She was spreading caps and muslins on
      the bushes&mdash;and, never before, did her eyes look so black, or her
      cheeks half so rosy. She littered a faint scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin! Master Hector, is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Susan, my beauty, to be sure it is.&rdquo; And with Hibernian affection
      we flew into each other&rsquo;s arms&mdash;and down went the basket with my
      mother&rsquo;s finery. I never reckoned the kisses I inflicted on the Abigail;
      but, poor soul, to do her justice, she bore them patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Hector, dear,&rdquo; she muttered poutingly, &ldquo;there are holes in the hedge,
      and some one might tell the mistress.&rdquo; Then, as if the recent contact of
      our lips had for the first time exhibited its sinful impropriety, she
      crossed herself like a true catholic, and continued, as I moved away,
      &ldquo;Blessed Mary! had the priest seen us, I were undone. Lord! but he&rsquo;s
      grown! Hark! I hear a foot. Hurry in, Master Hector. Your mother is dying
      to see you; and dinner has been waiting half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My reception by my parents was as warm as it was characteristic. Both were
      in the drawing-room when I entered it; and in a moment I was locked in my
      mother&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;How handsome!&rdquo; said she, as tears rolled down her cheeks.
      &ldquo;Alas! that he should be devoted to that horrible profession, Denis, and
      that his name should some fatal day be recorded in that list of bloodshed
      which always damps the joy of victory,&rdquo; and she pointed to the official
      account of a Peninsular battle which had that morning reached Kilcullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s was a very different reception. Moulded of sterner stuff, he
      eyed me as a crimp sergeant scrutinizes a doubtful recruit; then shaking
      me by the hand, he proceeded regularly with his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord! a finer lad never tapped a cartouch-box. Five feet eleven
      and a quarter at eighteen! He&rsquo;ll be size enough for the Lifeguards in a
      twelvemonth. Zounds! what is the woman snivelling about? Is it because her
      son comes home figure for a flanker, instead of growing a sneaking,
      shambling, round-shouldered, flat-footed, fish-eater, that the devil
      couldn&rsquo;t drill? But here comes the summons to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the cloth had been removed, and my mother had retired, the Colonel
      reverted to the first grand movement in my life, on which he descanted
      most learnedly; and, a little military pedantry apart, his advice and
      opinions were sound and soldierly. He reprobated play&mdash;gave serious
      warnings against debt&mdash;discouraged gallantry, and inculcated the
      necessity of duelling. He lamented, in the course of his harangue, the
      loss of my ancient preceptor Father Dominic; to himself, he stated, that
      the loss was irreparable&mdash;he could not, unfortunately, drink the left
      hand against the right, nor uncork a bottle without being bothered by a d&mdash;&mdash;d
      servant. He complained that he felt a twinge in his infirm shoulder&mdash;well,
      that was rheumatism; he had also an obnubilation in his eyes&mdash;but
      that was bile; it could not be what he drank:&mdash;by the way, he had two
      bottles of Page&rsquo;s best in.&mdash;He should go to bed&mdash;exhorted me to
      be up at cock-crow&mdash;gave me some parting admonitions&mdash;an order
      on a Dublin tailor for an outfit&mdash;a bundle of country bank-notes&mdash;his
      blessing into the bargain&mdash;shook my hand&mdash;and, with the
      assistance of Sergeant Brady, toddled off to his apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commander was scarcely gone, when Susan&rsquo;s black eye peered into the
      room cautiously, to ascertain that all was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist! Master Hector! Is the Colonel gone to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe for the night, my fair Susan. The house is all our own. Come in&mdash;shut
      the door, for I want to confess you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And finish the godly exercise you commenced in the flower-garden! No, no,
      Master Hector; no more of that. Come, your mother wants to see you alone&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      light you to her dressing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I attended the <i>demoiselle</i> immediately, and was inducted to her
      lady&rsquo;s chamber. When the door opened I found her seated at a work-table,
      with a book of religious exercises and a huge rosary before her. Bursting
      into tears, she clasped me to her bosom, and muttered in an under voice,
      &ldquo;Sit down, Hector&mdash;many months have elapsed since we met, and many
      more may probably pass over before we meet again. And so they have
      destined you for that horrible profession&mdash;and you are going
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, by peep of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hector, will you in one thing oblige me, and grant your mother a
      request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed a purse in my hand&mdash;and taking from the leaves of her
      Missal a small silken bag, opened my shirt collar, and bound it round my
      neck. I smiled at the ceremony, and submitted. It was, of course, some
      charm or reliquary; and though the one-armed commander would have laughed,
      at what he would have considered on my part a symptom of apostasy, I
      thought it was no crime to carry an inch or two of silk upon my person,
      when my compliance would render happy a mother who loved me so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; said she, after investing me with this important amulet,
      &ldquo;promise, for my sake, that you will wear it night and day; and, until
      misfortune overtakes, and all other hope fails&mdash;which Heaven grant
      may never happen!&mdash;that you will not unclose the cover, or read the
      writing of the Gospel.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Gospels are worn in Ireland as a protection against
     diseases and &ldquo;<i>diablerie</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I gave the pledge she required; took an affectionate leave; and, lighted
      by Susan, returned to the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lobbies, like flower-knots, are dangerous places for adieux! Poor Susan
      was faintly remonstrating against a second kiss, when a third actor popped
      upon the stage unexpectedly, and terminated at once the contest. The
      intruder was my foster-brother. All parties evinced annoyance; Marc Antony
      looked very silly, and the <i>demoiselle</i>, bounding up the stairs,
      leaned over the balustrades, and spoke a hurried farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven bless you, Master Hector&mdash;mind your poor mother&rsquo;s parting
      words, and all prosperity attend you.&rdquo; Then, turning a wrathful look at
      the &ldquo;fosterer,&rdquo; * she continued, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what that false villain says.
      Ah, you wicked wretch! are you not afraid the roof will fall?&rdquo; and,
      shaking her clenched hand at him, vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could have roused the anger of the dark-eyed Abigail was to me a
      puzzle: I entered the parlour, and the crest-fallen fosterer followed, and
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Marc, what&rsquo;s the matter? Your old friend, Susan, seems in but
      indifferent temper with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Toole fiddled with his hat, picked the wool off by pinches, and
      appeared wofully confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want me, Marc? or was it Susan you were looking for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to speak to you,&rdquo; said my foster-brother, &ldquo;for fear I
      should miss you in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marc, here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Master Hector, to try my fortune either in England, or the
      North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and quit my father&rsquo;s service? Think well of this, Marc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, troth, I can&rsquo;t hold the place, and all on account of an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! what happened you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marc picked the hat anew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the middle of trouble, and the sooner
      I&rsquo;m off, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken heads or broken vows; or, probably, a mixture of both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil a head I broke since the fair of Carrick, and the Carneys brought
      it on themselves; and in honesty I&rsquo;m at every man&rsquo;s defiance,&rdquo; returned
      the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what would you do in England, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I do in England?&rdquo; he repeated, like an echo. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I do
      anything?&mdash;shear, mow, wisp a horse, whip hounds, jump two-and-twenty
      feet, throw stone and sledge&mdash;and take my own part in fair and
      pattern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Marc, most of these accomplishments would only secure you a
      lodging in the cage, or a settlement in the stocks. But, in a word, what
      brings you away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Biddy O&rsquo;Dwyer, the dairymaid&mdash;the devil&rsquo;s luck attend her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew! Go on, Marc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants me to marry her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, I suppose, has pressing reasons for making the request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil a reason, only she took me to a cake.&rdquo; ** &ldquo;I comprehend the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks! it was all her own fault&mdash;she would keep dancing to the last.
      The night was dark, and we were hearty. *** I lost my way&mdash;and she
      her character.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglice, foster-brother.

     Ireland, and holden for the purposes of dancing, drinking,

     severely damaged.

     *** Anglicê, nearly drunk.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and why not repair the damage, Marc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it me! and she four years older? By this book&rdquo;&mdash;and he kissed his
      hat religiously&mdash;&ldquo;for all the ladies and priests that ever wore cap
      or vestment, I would not marry ye, Kitty O&rsquo;Dwyer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marc, you are upon this point the best judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in concealing anything, and you, my foster-brother, Master
      Hector. Kitty&rsquo;s a great Catholic, and a Carmelite to boot&mdash;and my
      lady and Father Grady will fairly banish me the country, when they hear
      that it was through me she got the blast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebel, Marc! Refuse, point-blank. Hold out manfully&mdash;and neither
      priest, nor bishop, can make you marry, if you don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll be made a world&rsquo;s wonder of!&rdquo; and Marc Antony groaned at
      the very thought. &ldquo;Called out in the chapel&mdash;cursed from the altar&mdash;bundled
      off to Ball&mdash;trotted up Croagh Patrick&mdash;ay, and as Father Grady
      will stick to Kitty like a burr, I may be despatched to Lough Dharg * with
      gravel in my shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad enough, Marc. And pray what is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil a choice have I left,&rdquo; said the fosterer, with a groan, &ldquo;good,
      bad, nor indifferent, but list or turn Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awkward alternatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marc smiled. &ldquo;And would I not have an elegant life of it afterwards in the
      servants&rsquo;-hall? Sorra two men in the house that I can&rsquo;t lick; but what
      could I do with the women? No, no, Master Hector!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it, Marc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of it already. The priest and my lady will hear all in the
      morning, and, faith, I&rsquo;ll give them leg-bail in the meantime. Are you not
      going to Dublin, Master Hector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by the blessin&rsquo; of God, there will be two of us there soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marc, have you any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a rap&mdash;but plenty for the taking it. I never go to Boyle upon a
      message, but there are half-a-dozen crimps at my heels; and every
      recruiting party that passes by, eyes me as if I had the cockade already
      mounted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are determined, Marc, I shall say nothing more; but before you
      choose your regiment, let me know, and probably the Colonel may stand your
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will, Master Hector. But, Holy Virgin, what an uproar the house
      will be in when they miss me in the morning! The priest roaring here&mdash;my
      lady sending there&mdash;Kitty singing wirrestrue ** in the dairy&mdash;and
      the ould Colonel delighted at the rookawn, and shouting Devil mend her!&rdquo;

      I laughed heartily at Mare&rsquo;s fanciful description of a scene, which his
      absence would so certainly occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; continued the fosterer, &ldquo;and mind, Master Hector, we&rsquo;ll
      meet when you least expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I slipped a bank-note into the fosterer&rsquo;s hands&mdash;Marc disappeared&mdash;and
      I sought my pillow. Where Mr. O&rsquo;Toole bestowed himself, I know not&mdash;but
      it was an eventful night for both. I, about to make my first start upon
      the stage of life, and honest Marc Antony flying from a choice of evils&mdash;matrimony
      or penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lovelier morning never broke than that on which I took my departure from
      Kilcullen. It was late in September. The hoar-frost curled gently upwards,
      yielding to the earliest sunbeams, as I rode from the stable-yard. Every
      thing was exciting to the spirits: the blackbird whistled in the copse,
      the partridge was calling from the stubble, the sheep-bells tinkled
      merrily, and all seemed happy and rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did a lighter-bosomed gentleman quit his father&rsquo;s house. Here was I,
      a holder of the king&rsquo;s commission, master of the best fencer in Roscommon,
      one hundred pounds in my pocket, a case of pistols at my saddle-bow;
      while, with a loose arm and a stout heart, I found myself jogging fairly
      on, though &ldquo;half the world were sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rode quickly forward: miles vanished, and at four o&rsquo;clock I had left my
      home thirty miles behind. With my future route I was unacquainted; but it
      ran through a wild barony, bleak though beautiful enough, interspersed
      with hills and valleys, and thickly studded with lakes and rivulets. The
      road was grass-grown and disused; but, being shorter and practicable to
      horsemen, I followed it rather than ride a few miles round. To dine and
      feed my horse, I halted at a public-house where four roads met; and, after
      an hour&rsquo;s rest, commenced my journey anew, to gain the mountain-village,
      where; my host apprized me, I was to sojourn for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lonely inn appeared that day to have no lack of customers. During my
      brief stay travellers stopped repeatedly, or drank spirits at the door and
      hurried on. They generally rode in companies of some half-dozen, were
      mounted upon country horses, and, from having a couple of kegs suspended
      across the croup, their calling was no mystery. Illicit distillation in
      this wild district was then extensively carried on,&mdash;and men engaged
      in this demoralizing traffic, like those who stopped at this house of
      entertainment, were constantly traversing the mountain-road, smuggling the
      prohibited liquor, or returning for a fresh supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      One party, consisting of three persons of rather a superior class,
      remained for dinner. They addressed their conversation occasionally to me,
      and evinced great curiosity to find out the place of my destination, and
      the reason that I preferred the mountain-road to that usually taken by
      ordinary travellers. I felt no disposition to be communicative on these
      points, and the strangers were far from satisfied with my replies. When my
      mare was brought to the door, my holsters did not escape their
      observation; and as I rode away, I overheard the tallest of the three
      exclaim, &ldquo;By Heaven! I&rsquo;ll bet five pounds that the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not hear the remainder of the remark. The occurrence not
      agreeable, however, with ten miles of a desolate ride before me. I had
      other besides personal cares. In my life I never had possessed one-fourth
      the sum I carried; and the pocket, rather than the person, alarmed me. I
      thought the matter over. I saw no fire-arms with the strangers, and of
      course I was fairly a match for three. My mare was fast; and I determined
      quietly to surmount a long and gradual rise, make play down the falling
      ground, and then bid pursuit defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorance of the locality rendered my last design abortive. Half way up
      the hill, a path but little used, if one could judge from its un-frequent
      hoof-marks, branched from the main road. I hesitated which to take; but of
      two bad paths, I chose the better, and followed the more beaten route.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rode a mile, topped the acclivity, and followed a path skirting a
      highland lake and traversing a long and heathy level. Anxiously I looked
      back, but not a traveller was visible. My fears vanished&mdash;and I
      smiled to think how very nervous the possession of property makes a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene before me was wild and picturesque. A long ravine skirted by a
      mountain-stream, that occasionally crossed the road through half-ruined
      bridges, descended between two lofty hills which completely shut out the
      setting sun. At the bottom of this romantic pass, a lake of considerable
      extent, interspersed with numerous islands, received the rivulets that
      hurried down the valley. In front, the sun was setting gloriously, and
      flung across the gorge of the ravine a curtain of burning gold which
      rested on the waters of the lake below. It was, indeed, a splendid
      landscape&mdash;and tradition added to its interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an eminence that overlooked the road and pass, the ruins of a square
      building were visible, now so much dilapidated, that it was impossible to
      determine whether it had been originally designed for the purposes of
      religion or of defence. In the centre of a green patch, scarcely a
      pistol-shot from the dismantled tower, the scathed stem of a solitary oak
      was standing. As it was, it would never have arrested the traveller&rsquo;s eye,
      had not a huge cairn of stones beneath it intimated that this lonely tree
      had witnessed some scenes of bloodshed. I pulled up my horse and viewed
      the cairn and ruin with attention, for my curiosity was excited, and
      chance enabled me to gratify it. An elderly, wild-looking, half-clad
      peasant was loitering on the road-side, attending a score or two of sheep.
      Abandoning his charge, he joined me willingly; and in very excellent Irish
      replied to my questions, and communicated the traditional story of the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that building, friend; and what does yonder cairn commemorate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story&rsquo;s long,&rdquo; replied the peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so is the mountain-road. Was it death by accident or treachery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant paused a moment, and then drily answered, &ldquo;There was no
      accident in the business, though three men perished; one was murdered and
      two were hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the particulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be strange if I did not. I was born in these hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and my fathers before. We have been for centuries herdsmen in these
      mountains. I have never been thirty miles from the spot where we stand;
      and every rock, and rill, and hillock, are familiar from early childhood,
      for on them my eyes first opened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A barrack, for soldiers to protect travellers from plunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the cairn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proves that their protection was sometimes unavailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not an armed force restrain vagabonds from plundering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore, it is hard to say,&rdquo; returned the herdsman. &ldquo;Are you going to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in haste thither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be there by noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The special commission sits there the following day. They say it will go
      hard with the men who killed the gauger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis said so; and if the circumstances attendant on the murder be such as
      are generally believed, they will deserve their fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant eyed me sharply, and then, with assumed indifference,
      observed, &ldquo;The devil is painted always blacker than he is; and something
      may still come out in the prisoners&rsquo; favour. I fear, poor fellows, that
      they will be prosecuted hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may be certain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued my companion, &ldquo;no doubt Bradley&rsquo;s death was sudden. But
      could it be otherwise? Many an aching heart he caused, and the curse of
      ruined men and houseless children pursued him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, we crossed a small hillock, where the mountain-path, which
      had diverged to the right, once more united itself to the main road. The
      lake extended itself for more than a mile on one side; and on the other a
      swamp, impassable alike to man and horse, stretched for a considerable
      distance between the rugged causeway and the bases of the contiguous high
      grounds. A deep stream winding through the centre of the morass and
      creeping lazily beneath a ruined bridge, lost itself in the blue waters of
      the lake. It was fortunate that my new acquaintance was beside me, or I
      should have been puzzled where to cross the stream; but, on inquiry, he
      told me there was a ford, and offered to point it out. For half an hour we
      jogged on sociably together, chatting on a subject which seemed to occupy
      my companion&rsquo;s every thought,&mdash;the approaching trial of the
      murderers. From time to time I observed, however, that he looked anxiously
      behind him; and suddenly a distant sound like that of coming horsemen made
      me turn my head. It was not fancy&mdash;three persons showed themselves
      above the ridge; they were the strangers I had encountered at the inn, and
      from the pace at which they rode, I had no doubt but they were in pursuit
      of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, from the first moment they discovered me, their object was
      perfectly apparent. One of them pointed me out; and, considering the
      rugged path they had to traverse, they increased their pace to a rapidity
      that appeared surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I insensible to coming clanger. What was to be clone, and how were
      they to be avoided? Before me, a broken bridge; behind, a pressing enemy;
      and escape cut off. I could observe, from numerous hoof-marks in the bog,
      the place where the river was fordable. My mare was fresh, and willingly
      obeyed a call. I started forward at a rattling pace, and once across the
      water, had little doubt of effecting an escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever were the herdsman&rsquo;s original intentions towards me&mdash;whether
      his designs were &ldquo;wicked or charitable&rdquo;&mdash;the appearance of the
      strangers made him at once a foe. The instant I spurred my mare, he caught
      up a stone and flung it with such precision, that it knocked my hat off,
      but, fortunately, only grazed my head. Then applying his finger to his
      lips, he uttered a wild and piercing whistle, which echoed through the
      rocks behind, and was repeated among the distant mountains. The signal was
      answered promptly. A dozen men, who had been resting in a hollow out of
      sight, suddenly sprang up; some rushed to the ford&mdash;others occupied
      the road&mdash;and all seemed ready and determined to bar my farther
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had brief time for consideration. To try the ford, guarded as it was,
      were idle; and to take the bridge, was to select as awkward a leap as ever
      proved the proverbial courage of a Roscommon rider. The latter only
      afforded any chance of escape; for I should inevitably be knocked upon the
      head at the ford, while floundering through the river. Accordingly, I
      nerved myself&rsquo; for the effort&mdash;took my mare in hand;&mdash;she was
      the sweetest fencer that ever carried an Irish gentleman!&mdash;the spur
      was answered by a rush at speed,&mdash;the bridge cleared at stroke&mdash;and
      we landed in sporting style, a full length beyond the chasm.

    <p>
      So far &ldquo;the work went bravely on.&rdquo; Although vigorously attacked by several
      assailants, blows from sticks and stones failed in unhorsing me, and I
      nearly succeeded in running the gauntlet safely. Two of these brigands
      were still to be passed, and I charged them at a slashing gallop. They
      retreated to either side, and avoided the threatened collision; but as I
      came thundering past, a rope dexterously thrown over the horse&rsquo;s head,
      caught me across the chest, and threw me from the saddle on the road with
      stunning violence. Before I could recover, I was seized, tied hand and
      foot, a sack thrown over me, lifted on a horse, and an intimation given,
      that on the slightest effort at outcry or escape, I should be consigned to
      the deep, <i>sans cérémonie</i>. The better portion of valour is
      discretion&mdash;and I determined to keep quiet&mdash;for however loose in
      keeping ordinary pledges these excellent persons might be, when a drowning
      match was in the ease, I felt assured that they would redeem their promise
      to the letter.

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s I hail no
      ambition to make a Turkish exit, and cause a vacancy in the Twenty-first
      Fusileers, to use a bull, &ldquo;even before it was filled,&rdquo; I submitted with
      Christian fortitude, and held my peace accordingly. Unresisted, the
      captors bore me across a shingly beach; for I heard the loose stones
      rattle as their hurried steps displaced them. In a few minutes they
      reached a boat, and bundled me in with scanty ceremony, as &ldquo;honest Jack&rdquo;
       was ejected into Datchet Mead. Directly, several men jumped across the
      thwarts&mdash;the keel grated on the gravel&mdash;the oars fell rapidly on
      the water&mdash;and away we went, Heaven knew whither!
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the beach, my captors appeared to consider a longer silence
      unnecessary; for they laughed and jested with each other, although what
      seemed marvellous good fun to them, was death to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Tom,&rdquo;&mdash;said a pleasant gentleman from the shore,&mdash;&ldquo;God
      bless the venture! sure it&rsquo;s the first ye carried of the kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; observed a second, &ldquo;make mistakes; men are not malt; and be sure
      ye don&rsquo;t give the contents of yonder sack a steeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done worse however, before now,&rdquo; returned a rough voice beside me,
      &ldquo;and on my poor conscience, I think a few stones in the bottom of the bag
      would make all right, and save both time and trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supposing it no harm to share a conversation in which I was so essentially
      concerned, I muttered an indistinct dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s mumbling about?&rdquo; inquired a person in the boat&rsquo;s bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; was politely responded by my next neighbour, as
      he applied knuckles, hard as ebony, to my ribs, I presume to enforce his
      admonition. &ldquo;<i>Badda-hurst</i>, * or I&rsquo;ll slip you across the gunnel
      before you have time to bless yourself. Pull, will ye? Hurry to the
      island; for before this time I should have been half way to Carrick Beg,
      instead of ferrying blackguard gaugers to Innisteagles.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hold your tongue.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ferrying blackguard gaugers! &ldquo;What did the fellow mean? It was a singular
      observation, and I ventured to remark it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;muttering again!&rdquo; replied the voice. &ldquo;Can you swim, friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I managed to answer, that &ldquo;I had never tried it, tied neck and heels
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; rejoined my agreeable companion, with a
      second application of his fist, &ldquo;if you open your lips before we part
      company, over you go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking him. We were on a deep lake, and I had a determined
      gentleman to deal with; so I resolved accordingly to remain still as a
      mouse, and preserve a dignified silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect that my decision was a wise one. From broken observations which
      I overheard, I soon found that the voyage was about to terminate. I felt
      in mortal tribulation. Suspense, however, was quickly ended. The keel
      grated on the sand&mdash;strange voices welcomed my guard of honour, and
      told that my island was not, &ldquo;like Crusoe&rsquo;s,&rdquo; uninhabited. The sack being
      lifted out and laid upon the sward, a parting glass was emptied to my
      better health amidst uproarious peals of merriment. Presently, the parties
      bade each other good night; and those who had brought me re-embarked,
      rowed merrily away, and left me in a pleasant uncertainty on a very
      important point, and that was whether I should be sunk or smothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, from the jocular demeanour of the islanders and the immediate
      departure of my abductors, I felt half assured that no truculent design
      upon my life was meditated after all. This was consolatory, certainly;
      although an interrupted journey,&mdash;imprisonment in a sack,&mdash;a
      lost mare, and a despoiled portmanteau,&mdash;all these were bad enough.
      Short space for sombre communings was allowed. Two pair of lusty arms
      lifted me from the ground, bore me through a narrow and difficult pass,
      placed me on my legs, and untied the bag, when down dropped the canvass,&mdash;and
      when I could see distinctly, a strange scene presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had felt a glow of increasing heat, and could perceive a stream of light
      strengthen gradually as we penetrated the thick brush-wood. At first,
      dazzled by the blaze, objects were more like a confused vision than
      reality; but presently my eyes became accustomed to the glare, and I found
      myself surrounded by several huge fires, at which nearly a score of men
      were busily engaged in illicit distillation. In my mountain walks, I had
      frequently discovered in some secluded valley a smuggler engaged in this
      lawless vocation; but the hovel and apparatus were so slightly constructed
      and so easily removed, that at the first intimation of danger the still
      was carried off, the fire extinguished, the sheeling torn down, and
      nothing left but a heap of sods and rubbish to console the gauger on his
      arrival, by proving that his information had been most correct, and the
      distillers far too watchful. But here, every thing was constructed on a
      permanent and extensive scale, which evinced a perfect feeling of
      security, or the determination, at all risks, of continuing this lawless
      and demoralizing trade. On furnaces of solid masonry three large stills
      were working,&mdash;numerous wooden vessels were filled with potale,&mdash;and
      sacks of malt and barley, kegs containing spirits, and an abundant supply
      of peat-fuel, everywhere met the eye. Contiguous to the fires, sundry
      hovels were erected; the walls of turf, and roofs of heather&mdash;designed,
      it would appear, for the accommodation of a number of swine and their
      proprietors; and both, in point of comfort, seemed to be on a precise
      equality. The brute and the biped were indeed happily associated; for the
      ragged clothes, haggard looks, bleared eyes, and that half-drunken
      stupidity, which an endless tasting of ardent spirits always produces,
      showed, as they flitted back and forward in the red and lurid atmosphere,
      a group of beings that might be safely classed as low even in the lowest
      grade of civilized society.
    </p>
    <p>
      My supporters left me, and retired to a cabin apart from the other hovels;
      while I underwent a careless examination by some swart figures, who
      occasionally passed me bearing turf to the furnaces. Relieved from a most
      annoying species of restraint, I felt little apprehension for the future,
      although the cause for which I had been kidnapped remained as much a
      mystery as ever. In a few minutes, a man tapped me on the shoulder, and
      bade me &ldquo;follow and fear nothing.&rdquo; I obeyed. He led me to the retired hut
      whither my quondam friends had gone before; and there I found them quite
      at their ease, refreshing themselves most liberally after their successful
      exertions in my arrest and deportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rude, but not uncomfortable hovel; cribs and sleeping-places
      occupying one end, and a fire of charred turf blazing in the other. In the
      centre stood a rough bench, on which were spread plates of the coarsest
      delft, an earthen greybeard containing undiluted whisky, a jug of water,
      and a couple of horn drinking cups; while a tallow candle, stuck in an
      iron trivet, lighted this uninviting board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other objects, and of a very different description, met the eye. In a
      remote corner of the cabin a score of rusted firelocks were loosely piled;
      and, on the couples of the rafters, sundry fishing-rods and gaffs, a
      draft-net, and an eel-spear, were deposited. All indicated a lawless
      community and wild existence; while a forbidding-looking hag, broiling
      steaks upon the coals,&mdash;which operation a rough and brindled lurcher
      was contemplating with fixed attention,&mdash;completed a strange, but
      interesting picture of savage life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; inquired one of my abductors, with tolerable civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;confinement in a sack does not generally
      improve the appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you hurt by the fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much; although I fancy it would have been to you a matter of small
      consideration whether I broke my neck or scratched my finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; responded the second ruffian; &ldquo;upon my soul, I should have
      regretted it; for, to give the devil his due, you took the brook and
      bridge in sporting style. She&rsquo;s a sweet mare, that. There was a day I
      could have ridden her to fortune. I began life, sir, a whipper to Lord
      Longford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, friend, I must in candour tell you, that you have not changed for
      the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I have not&rdquo;&mdash;and the fellow sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, may I inquire, wherefore I am deprived of liberty, after having been
      waylaid, robbed, and nearly murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whipper shook his head, while his companion roughly desired me to ask
      no impertinent questions; then, pointing to the table, on which the hag
      had placed a quantity of broiled mutton&mdash;apparently sufficient for a
      dozen persons instead of three&mdash;he added, in a more encouraging tone,
      &ldquo;Take a seat, neighbour; there are few in our trade would treat a gauger
      so civilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Fellow, <i>I am no gauger</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what do you call yourself?&rdquo; he added, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same&mdash;a gauger and a revenue officer are
      brothers&rsquo; children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the revenue, but the army&mdash;I am a lieutenant in the
      Twenty-first Fusileers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you are!&rdquo; ejaculated the whipper, with marked surprise. &ldquo;Pray,
      sir, are you not Mr. Parker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my name is O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what family?&rdquo; said the other ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family of Kilcullen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell and furies!&rdquo; exclaimed both together. &ldquo;What is the meaning of all
      this? I fancy we are in the centre of a hobble. Are you, sir, son of
      Colonel O&rsquo;Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many arms has he?&rdquo; asked the keeper, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one&mdash;the left he lost in Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you going to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To join my regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why take the mountain road?&rsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply, because it was the shortest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quondam whipper gave a long and significant whistle; while his
      companion started up and left the hut abruptly, although the Leonora of
      the smugglers&rsquo; hovel called loudly after him, that &ldquo;the steaks were
      cooling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was but a brief space absent; and returned accompanied by an old
      grey-headed, blear-eyed, and besotted wretch, who instantly commenced a
      rigid scrutiny of my features. From the first moment, he expressed doubt
      and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil!&rdquo; said the ruffian who had brought him to examine me&mdash;&ldquo;what
      are you shaking your head at, old boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; but you have bagged the wrong fox,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;A
      nice job you have made of it, Murty Doolan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is&rsquo;nt that Parker the gauger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker, the devil!&rdquo; rejoined the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much Parker as it is
      my grandmother. Ye blind beggar, this chap has a straight eye, and Parker
      could squint through a bugle horn. He! he! he!&rdquo; and he chuckled at his Own
      wit; &ldquo;wait till somebody hears it. All, this comes of not taking my advice&mdash;this
      comes of employing strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the whipper, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no help for spilt milk. What&rsquo;s to be
      done, Gaffer? Can&rsquo;t we grab the right one yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, like enough, after Sullivan is hanged; for nothing can save him now.
      What will ye do with this lad?&rdquo; and he nodded carelessly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve him, I suppose, as ye did &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused and laughed, &ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n ye, you ould doting scoundrel&mdash;how dare ye mention
      that business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew&mdash;how hot ye are, Murty? Well, I must hurry back, or Phaddeein,
      the fool, will run the still too close, and spoil the whisky with the
      faints, as he did the last brewing. A nice job! That&rsquo;s what I call taking
      the wrong sow by the ear. He! he! he!&rdquo; and away the old man toddled to
      attend to his favourite employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a cursed mistake,&rdquo; remarked the ruffian companion of the whipper;
      &ldquo;and when the master hears it, all of us will come to trouble. Come, my
      friend, let&rsquo;s have some supper. Your seizure will cause more vexation than
      your neck is worth,&mdash;sit down,&rdquo; and turning up a keg, he placed
      himself upon it, and attacked the broiled meat manfully. The whipper,
      following his example, settled himself upon an inverted cleeve, * pointing
      out a stool, the seat of honour, for my especial use. Undecided, whether
      to accept their hospitality and sup in villanous company for once, or hold
      myself aloof and eschew all fellowship with such scoundrels, I wearied the
      politeness of the whipper, who, unable to resist temptation longer,
      assailed the steaks with vigour&mdash;when a voice from without caused my
      companions to spring from their seats as if the food were poisoned. Next
      moment, a strange personage whom I had not seen before, strode in, fixed
      an earnest and suspicious glance on me&mdash;then, turning to my captors,
      exclaimed in a voice of thunder,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The Irish name for a turf-basket.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villains! Who is this stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gauger, Parker,&rdquo; both muttered in a tremulous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you precious scoundrels! Off with you! Take that woman away!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      waving his hand, my guard of honour vanished at his bidding, attended by
      the alarmed cook, and leaving the unknown and myself <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurning the basket into the corner, which the whipper had respectfully
      abdicated on his entrance, the unknown walked to the fire with an air that
      bespoke authority, and which seemed to say, &ldquo;This island&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; To form
      any opinion of his face or figure was impossible; a loose-made frieze
      wrapping-coat concealed the one, while a high collar and slouched hat
      masked the other effectually. I could observe, however, that in height he
      was above the middle size, and that his eyes were dark and penetrating.
      Promptly he commenced a conversation; and his address was haughty, curt,
      and unceremonious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, <i>who are you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger, brought here against his will; and wherefore&mdash;you, sir,
      can best tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; continued the unknown, &ldquo;inform me under what circumstances you
      have been arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you require any information on that subject?&rsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not, I need not have asked you to detail them. Be quick, sir; it
      will save me time, and probably do you some service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I simply narrated the recent occurrences, from my meeting with the
      strangers at the lonely inn, until I had been enlarged upon the island. At
      different parts of my detail the muffled stranger exhibited symptoms of
      displeasure, and once or twice I could hear his teeth grind, as if he
      struggled to suppress a burst of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said he, as I ended the narrative of my captivity, &ldquo;you are a
      young soldier, it would appear; and this is an excellent earnest of the
      troublesome profession you have chosen. But, jesting apart, you have
      received much ill-usage, and been stupidly and unnecessarily deprived of
      liberty and effects. Both shall be restored; and all the satisfaction
      which circumstances will admit of, shall be offered in atonement for an
      unintentional aggression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a whistle from his bosom; and its shrill summons was promptly
      answered by a smart, active lad, dressed in a sailor&rsquo;s jacket and
      trowsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man the boat, and give the signal.&rdquo; The sailor disappeared, and the
      unknown again addressed himself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you accompany me, and trust for your night&rsquo;s entertainment to my
      good offices&mdash;or, would you rather remain and share that
      inviting-looking supper which by my visit, I fear, has not been much
      improved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, and assured him I had not the least ambition to cultivate a
      farther intimacy with those worthy gentlemen who had already taken too
      much trouble on my account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then&mdash;the boat is ready,&rdquo; he said, as a piercing whistle
      was heard from the shore. &ldquo;Follow me, closely; the path, though short, is
      difficult even in daylight to a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Entering the copse and pushing through thick underwood, we reached a sandy
      beach, where a gig, with four rowers seated on the thwarts, was waiting. I
      was ceremoniously handed in and accommodated with a boat cloak; while the
      unknown took the yoke-ropes of the rudder, and desired the men to &ldquo;give
      way.&rdquo; The crew &ldquo;flung from their oars the spray,&rdquo; and broke the water with
      a regular stroke, which showed them to be practised pullers. Away we shot
      across the lake,&mdash;and, to my infinite satisfaction, left &ldquo;the lonely
      isle,&rdquo; which, even under an assurance that it possessed another Calypso, I
      should not have been tempted to revisit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark and still, but through the haze the outline of the
      shore was seen ahead. I looked towards the island we were leaving; but,
      excepting a feeble glow of red still visible upon the dusky sky, there was
      nothing to betray its secret, or intimate that this solitary place had
      been chosen for &ldquo;lawless intent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We neared the shore, and entered a narrow inlet that penetrated, as it
      seemed, by an opening in the hill side, into a wood of full-grown forest
      timber. Gradually the passage became more confined, until the oars had
      scarcely space to pull between the banks, while branches of oak and beech
      uniting above our heads, gave an additional darkness to the evening. In a
      few moments we reached its termination,&mdash;a small natural basin with a
      jetty of rough masonry. The steersman ran the boat alongside, landed on
      the wharf, and desired me to follow. I willingly obeyed, and the unknown
      led the way in silence, until we were beyond the hearing of the boatmen,
      when, suddenly stopping, he thus addressed me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a resident here&mdash;this country is not my own, but although I
      cannot offer you hospitality myself, I shall yet manage to obtain it.
      Scarcely a gun-shot distance from this place there stands a solitary
      mansion-house, embosomed in this oak wood. That road will conduct you to
      it. Go, knock at the door, and ask for Mr. Hartley. Tell him simply that
      you are a stranger,&mdash;that you need food and lodging,&mdash;and, if I
      be not deceived, you will have little occasion to urge the request a
      second time. Of what has occurred, say little; of what may occur, say
      less. I shall have your mare attended to, and your property recovered and
      restored; ay, were its value ten times greater. We may meet under more
      agreeable circumstances than we did this evening. Farewell. Stay&mdash;one
      word more. You will probably be introduced to a lady at Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s,
      some two or three years younger than yourself. She is an only daughter,
      educated in retirement, unacquainted with the world, and her existence,
      beyond the inmates of yonder mansion, actually unknown. Gentlemen of the
      sword, deal, I am told, extensively in gallantry. If this be so, reserve
      yours; for Mr. Hartley, as I have heard, wishes that his daughter shall
      continue &lsquo;of worldly things in happy ignorance;&rsquo; and any pointed attention
      on your part to his ward, would prove any thing but acceptable. You
      understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do; and believe me, my good Mentor, that your friend&rsquo;s fair
      daughter has little to fear from one who has had death in expectancy for
      two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Proceed; and you have but to
      tell your wants at the house, and have them attended to. You will however
      require a guide, for probably Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s dogs might annoy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled; and the same boatman again obeyed the signal. To him he gave
      orders to attend me; bade me good night; and turned into an opening in the
      copse, leaving me with my guide, and with the pleasant necessity of
      presenting myself to Mr. Hartley,&mdash;an unexpected, an unbidden, and,
      not improbably, an unwelcome guest.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s we proceeded, I
      endeavoured to lead my companion into conversation, and glean from him
      some information touching the place and the personage we were about to
      honour with a midnight visit. At first, Andy Beg *&mdash;for so the other
      boatmen named him&mdash;affected ignorance of Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s general
      history; and said that all he knew &ldquo;for certain&rdquo; was, that he had been a
      great traveller, and bought, a few years ago, a large mountain property,
      whose extent and revenues bore most ridiculous proportions;&mdash;the one
      exceeding some square miles, the other not amounting in value to the
      rental of an English farm. He added, that &ldquo;he had plenty of money, few
      acquaintances, lived entirely to himself, kept a very good house, and kept
      every body out of it.&rdquo; In short, the total of my intelligence was small
      and not encouraging. Mr. Hartley being wealthy and inhospitable, having

    <p>
      the reception of a stranger like myself, making an unceremonious call
      after sunset, seemed indeed rather a questionable matter. But it was
      necessary to make an attempt to gain admission; for, assuredly, any thing
      was better than to be cooped up on that infernal island.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * <i>Anglice</i>, Little Andy.
</pre>
    <p>
      As we issued from the wooded avenue, the moon had risen above the trees,
      and showed us a solitary building standing in the centre of an open glade,
      and surrounded by a rustic paling. A terrier promptly gave the alarm, and
      dogs of divers sizes and descriptions joined in the challenge. But Andy
      appeared to be an old acquaintance; they ceased barking when his voice was
      recognised, and permitted us to pass through a wicket in the enclosure,
      and enter a gravelled walk that approached the dreaded mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, you require me no longer; and I have particular business to
      transact before morning. Knock and fear nothing. The dogs will not annoy
      you.&rdquo; So saying, Andy passed through the wicket, and left me to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood for a minute to gain time for recollection, and examine the
      appearance of the building. There was nothing remarkable in the exterior,
      and all within the house appeared dark and silent; at least, the latticed
      window? were so jealously blinded, that it was impossible to discover
      aught of the interior. I took courage&mdash;advanced to the door, and
      tapped modestly like one rather dubious of admission. Again, I repeated
      the knock, and a slight bustle within told that the summons was heard.
      Presently a chain was removed, bolts were withdrawn, and an old man
      dressed in plain blue livery stood in the doorway, and civilly inquired my
      business. My tale was briefly told. The servant bowed, and left me in the
      hall, while he went to apprize his master that a late visitor had arrived.
      Returning directly, he requested me to follow him&mdash;and leading the
      way down a long passage, conducted me to a well-lighted chamber, and
      announced that Mr. Hartley would wait upon me immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I was, in military parlance, safe within the body of the place, and
      all the approaches carried without opposition. So far the work went
      bravely on; and, like a prudent soldier, I occupied the interval of
      expectation in examining the interior, to enable me if possible to form
      some idea of the quality of the inmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, though small, exhibited good taste and considerable elegance.
      The furniture and hangings were designed with great simplicity, but formed
      evidently of costly materials. A harp and guitar, numerous music-books,
      and several cases filled with well-bound volumes, bespoke the refinement
      of the owner. But the pictures were still more striking; they were
      generally oil paintings, and framed magnificently; and with these the
      walls were completely covered from the ceiling to the very base. The
      mantel-piece was still more remarkable. It was crowded with what are
      termed articles of <i>vertu</i>, being curious carvings in ivory and
      porcelain, of great value. There were also some oriental toys in silver
      filagree, shell snuff-boxes of unequalled beauty, and others of massive
      gold. But what fixed my attention at once, was a cabinet picture of small
      size, that rested on the centre of the slab&mdash;and which, even to an
      unpractised eye, appeared in its style and execution a <i>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painting represented a young man, dressed in the fanciful costume of
      an Eastern rover, holding a midnight interview with a beautiful girl, who
      wore the habit of a <i>religieuse</i>. Moonlight, a seashore, a monastic
      building half-hidden by trees of tropic growth, with a vessel in the
      distance, formed the scene. One arm of the corsair clasped the nun; while
      the other pointed to the ship, whose canvas, hanging loosely, indicated a
      readiness for sailing&mdash;and the rover&rsquo;s action seemed as if he was
      &ldquo;whispering her fears away,&rdquo; and urging the novice to accompany him. The
      character of both figures was admirably marked. In the rover&rsquo;s handsome
      features there was much to admire, and more to fear. The expression was
      that of high courage, mingled with a haughty recklessness, that might
      either be caused by personal indifference to danger or a disregard of
      suffering in others. But in the beautiful <i>religieuse</i> there was a
      confiding love so gentle, so fixed, so unsuspecting, that one dwelt with
      pleasure on a face, where every best property of woman seemed combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dresses of the twain were even more dissimilar than the character of
      the features. His costume was a tight jacket and expansive trowsers,
      belted with an Indian sash, which, while it displayed the symmetry of a
      faultless figure, permitted the wearer to put forth his strength with
      graceful freedom. Had his wild profession been doubtful, the Albanian cap,
      ornamented pistols, sabre and poniard, would have betrayed his calling.
      His beautiful companion wore the dress of the Ursulines; the back-turned
      hood displayed the sweetest face imaginable, while the hand that rested on
      the rover&rsquo;s arm, as if to stay his departure, might have formed a study
      for Canova.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture fascinated me; all was forgotten while I gazed upon it. I
      looked again. Despite the darkening influence of sun and storm, a thick
      moustache, and foreign costume, the corsair&rsquo;s aspect was decidedly
      British. It was a fair skin embrowned by climate, with which a wild and
      martial carriage and hair of raven blackness accorded well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in silent admiration&mdash;now gazing on &ldquo;the bold brigand&rdquo;&mdash;now
      enraptured with the sweet gentleness of the confiding girl, who seemed
      ready to abandon &ldquo;home and heaven&rdquo; for &ldquo;her wild love,&rdquo; I did not hear the
      door open until the host was almost standing at my side. Addressing me in
      a voice of peculiar sweetness, he bade me a warm welcome, apologized for
      not receiving me in the hall; and then telling me that supper was in
      readiness, he led me with excellent tact into a general conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked on indifferent subjects for a few minutes, while gradually my
      self-possession returned. Although described by the unknown as stern and
      suspicious, and by Andy as misanthropic and unamiable, my host seemed kind
      and hospitable to a marvel. Just then the door opened again, a girl of
      remarkable beauty glided in, and Mr. Hartley led her forward. &ldquo;This, sir,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;is my daughter; and this gentleman, Isidora, is our guest.&rdquo; We
      both cast down our eyes; she in maiden timidity colouring to the very
      brow, and I&mdash;I shame to own it&mdash;blushing like a country orator
      addressing &ldquo;the unwashed&rdquo; for the first time. I muttered a confused
      apology for an intrusion at that late hour, said something about bad
      roads, a lame horse, and Heaven knows what beside, to which she gave a
      gentle acceptation. I raised my eyes. By heaven! there stood the corsair&rsquo;s
      mistress! ay, there in youthful loveliness&mdash;and the host,&mdash;all
      his bland expression gone, as, steadily regarding us, he looked with
      scornful indifference beneath his coal-black brows (but that his years
      doubled the corsair&rsquo;s in the painting,)&mdash;his haughty curl of lip and
      eyebrow would have half persuaded me that he had himself been a rover of
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and luckily for me (for I was &ldquo;regularly bothered,&rdquo;) the
      blue-coated servitor announced supper. I presented my arm to Miss Hartley,
      and through a side door we entered the eating room. By a singular
      self-command, the host&rsquo;s features had regained their previous expression
      of urbanity; his manner was courteous, his welcome encouraging, and he
      seemed the very opposite of Andy Beg&rsquo;s description, when he called him
      repulsive and inhospitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could surpass the neatness of the apartment. In all its
      arrangements simplicity had been regarded; yet still there was an evidence
      of luxury and wealth in the quantity and massive fashion of the plate,
      which seemed better suited to the mansion of a noble than the retreat of a
      recluse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did intruder time his visit more opportunely, if the excellence of a
      supper were the proof. The meal passed over agreeably, though in point of
      performance the actors differed. Miss Hartley ate little, her father
      turned out an indifferent trencher-man; but, faith, I made up for this
      double deficiency, as the skeleton that left the table of what came there,
      a goodly wild-duck, proved. No wonder; since I dined at the lonely inn, if
      varied exercise could produce a healthy appetite, mine should have been in
      top condition. But hunger has its limit,&mdash;mine was at last appeased;
      supper removed, wine and fruit were placed upon the table, and old
      blue-coat disappeared, leaving me perfectly satisfied with my quarters,
      and much more so with my company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host having filled his glass, pushed the decanters across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, drink; you will own that Port wine sound, and this Madeira has
      circumnavigated the world; but I recommend the Burgundy. Probably, as it
      seems the custom of the country, you are not a wine-drinker after supper,
      should you therefore prefer them, you will find cognac and hollands on the
      buffet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Egad, the more I saw of it, the more I admired the establishment. Burgundy
      and Madeira that had circumnavigated the world&mdash;these formed very
      gentlemanly tipple to sport under a racketty old roof, to a self-invited
      visitor, who had dropped in, like a priest collecting corn, with a &ldquo;God
      save all here.&rdquo; Nor did I neglect the invitation. The bottle passed
      freely, previous restraint wore away, and some allusion of Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s
      to a military life, led me by degrees into a private history of my own,
      until
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the very moment when he bade me tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I afterwards recollected that some of Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s questions could only
      have been asked by a person to whom the earlier history of my parents was
      intimately known, but I did not notice it at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charmed at the urbanity of my host, and flattered that my young Desdemona
      expressed an interest in my fortunes, and
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Gave me for my pains a world of smiles,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I became momentarily more intimate and at ease; deciding that the unknown
      and his boatman, Andy Beg, were little better than libellers, when they
      insinuated aught against the suavity of temper and sociability of my
      excellent host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isidora had risen to leave the room, and something in her look or attitude
      recalled the fascinating picture of the corsair&rsquo;s mistress to my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like!&rdquo; I muttered, loud enough to awake the attention of her father.
      &ldquo;I would be sworn that picture on the mantel-piece of the drawing-room was
      painted for this young lady,&mdash;ay, and bating some twenty years, the
      gallant rover looks your very image, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never was a more unlucky guess hazarded by a blundering Irishman! Had
      lightning struck the building, or a grenade dropped hissing through the
      ceiling, the effect could not have caused so fierce an explosion as that
      which followed this infelicitous discovery. In a moment a lurid glare
      flashed underneath the host&rsquo;s contracted brows; while Isidora, pale as
      marble, leaned against the buffet for support. Persuaded that I had
      committed some villanous impertinence, I sprang forward to assist her;
      but, with extraordinary strength, her father pushed me like a child aside,
      led his daughter from the room, closed the door, and left me in
      undisturbed possession, to commune with my own thoughts, and congratulate
      myself on the brilliant effect that my first essay as a connoisseur in
      painting had produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short, but to me most painful, interval of suspense, Mr. Hartley
      returned. His rage had subsided; every trace of its first violence had
      disappeared; but his features wore an expression of stern rebuke, that
      made me far more uncomfortable than if personal violence were threatened
      for my offending. He leaned his back against the sideboard, and after
      regarding me for a minute with a fixed look, thus commenced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, you have wantonly annoyed those who were anxious to show you
      kindness; and, by a most unhappy and impertinent allusion to what
      concerned <i>you</i> nothing, you have in <i>me</i> roused feelings, which
      I wish suppressed for ever, and recalled to my daughter&rsquo;s memory an event
      that can only bring with it painful recollections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened patiently thus far; but, unable to restrain my feelings,
      interrupted the expostulation, while my look and manner evinced that my
      contrition was sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, Mr. Hartley, my offence was wholly unintentional! While
      waiting for you in the drawing-room, by mere accident I noticed this
      unlucky picture. Had I fancied that a secret connexion existed between
      that painting and any event of your past life, I should have scorned to
      cast an eye upon it, as much as I would to pry into yonder open letter
      that lies upon the mantel-piece. I only saw in it, what I considered a
      beautiful creation of the fancy; some imaginary scene&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly my host interrupted me.&mdash;&ldquo;Creation of the fancy! No, no,
      boy; all sad&mdash;sad reality! Oh, Heaven, that the scene were indeed
      imaginary!&rdquo;&mdash;and, apparently overcome with some fearful recollection,
      he turned his face towards the fire, and I could observe a convulsive
      shudder creep over him as he writhed in silent agony. I was dreadfully
      mortified at the misery which my folly had occasioned, and determined at
      once to quit a house in which my visit had proved so mischievous. I went
      forward, and took Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you pardon a stupid impertinence of mine, which has unhappily
      recalled afflicting recollections? When I am gone, excuse my imprudence to
      your daughter, and assure her how sincerely I repent my folly. And now,
      farewell, sir,&mdash;I feel myself an unwelcome visitor, and will relieve
      you of my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made a movement towards the door; but my host waved his hand as if to
      detain me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said lie; &ldquo;it is nearly midnight, and the first place where you
      could obtain a lodging is ten miles distant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have walked twenty before now,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;to shoot a dozen snipes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road is bad and difficult to find,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can rouse a peasant on the way side, and he will guide me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dangerous, besides,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;a murder was committed there but
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;I have little indeed to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put your trust in honest Juvenal,&rdquo; said he, with a faint smile.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cantabit vacuus&rsquo;&mdash;it is a good adage; no security better against
      robbery than an empty pocket. But they may knock you on the head, and
      discover when too late&mdash;that you are not a gauger;&rdquo; and he gave me a
      side look, to see what effect the allusion had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, sir,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;I trust that that mistake shall not occur a
      second time, although to it I owe the pleasure of your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, with real or simulated surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, sir,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sit down and tell me the adventure. Come, my dear boy,&rdquo; he
      added, in tones so soft, so kind, that I was amazed at the sudden
      transition from anger to urbanity; &ldquo;all is over and forgotten. I will make
      your peace with Isidora in the morning, and your penalty shall be&mdash;a
      short lecture and another bottle. You are young&mdash;your foot has only
      touched the threshold of the stage of life&mdash;at your age one sees only
      the sun-streak in the sky, but never looks for the cloudbank that lies
      behind it. What you to-night intended in idle compliment, exploded a
      hidden mine that all but wrecked our friendship in its very opening. Be
      advised by one who knows the world, or ought to know it: restrain
      curiosity in all that concerns another; and know men well, before you pry
      into their secrets. At the conclusion of this lecture my host took a flask
      of Burgundy from the sideboard, extracted the cork, and down we sate <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      again; and, at his desire, I narrated my evening encounter with the
      smugglers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour,&rdquo; he observed, as I ended, &ldquo;a perilous adventure; and,
      faith, the scoundrels gave you coarse usage. I know the scene of your
      flight; a rough road to gallop over, and the broken bridge, too&mdash;did
      your horse carry you across that ugly chasm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took it in stroke, and never touched it with a toe. But for the villains
      with the rope, I should have had the race hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;these, &lsquo;misbegotten knaves,&rsquo; as Jack Falstaff would call them,
      they ended the affair effectually. Egad&mdash;the rope was an excellent
      contrivance to dismount a cavalier. But you must have had a severe fall?
      Are you bruised?&mdash;are you injured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, I fancy&mdash;although I do feel sore and stiff about the back
      and shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be examined. I shall be leech for the nonce; and I am not a bad
      surgeon. Come, let us finish the flask, and then I will show you to a
      chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time-piece on the chimney-piece chimed three quarters, the wine
      disappeared, I rose to retire; when my host took up a chamber-lamp and led
      the way. Proceeding along a narrow gallery, we entered an apartment at its
      extremity. Mr. Hartley lighted the candles. &ldquo;These are your quarters,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Here make yourself at home, and I will return in a few minutes
      and pronounce upon your bruises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could surpass the neatness of my dormitory. The curtains and bed
      furniture were chintz, with drawers, cabinets, and wardrobes, all of
      Indian workmanship. A glorious fire of bog-deal was blazing in the grate,
      and on the table I remarked a dressing-case, with every thing requisite
      even for the toilet of a man of fashion&mdash;while a morning gown,
      slippers, and change of linen, were in process of airing for my service.
      But other objects caught my eye. Over the chimney-piece hung a curious
      collection of fire-arms; and beside them, some splendid sabres were
      suspended. Some were of foreign shape, and richly ornamented with gold and
      silver mounting; others, made by English artists, were distinguished from
      the rest by their exquisite finish and simplicity, while not a few bore
      semblance of great antiquity, and seemed retained rather as objects of
      curiosity than use.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return, Mr. Hartley found me admiring his armoury; but I neither
      hazarded a remark nor dared to ask a question. The lesson I had recently
      received would last me for awhile; and had a ghost and goule been sitting
      in the corner, <i>tête-à-tête</i>, I should have scarcely ventured to
      inquire &ldquo;What the devil brought them there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some handsome weapons in that collection?&rdquo; said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They appear most valuable,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I am not a judge of foreign arms;
      but I see some English guns of beautiful workmanship.&rdquo; Mr. Hartley passed
      these lightly by; but taking down a sabre and pistols, he examined them
      with marked attention. The latter he replaced, but retained the sabre in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that sword a valuable one?&rdquo; My host started. I felt my face flush. Had
      I again committed mischief? But Mr. Hartley, on this score, relieved me
      speedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me is this sabre valuable? It is <i>invaluable</i>. The blade is
      of the purest Damascene. Observe its beautiful tracery; and its temper is
      so exquisite, that, without indenting its own edge to the extent of a
      pin&rsquo;s point, I could have once shorn that bar of iron in twain,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he pointed to the grate. A knock was heard at the door. &ldquo;It is Dominique&mdash;Come
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a new and very remarkable personage presented himself. He was
      a negro of uncommon height; and if his shape could be relied on, of
      herculean strength. His limbs, though too heavy to be graceful, were
      finely moulded; his shoulders square, his breast ample. He wore a light
      jacket and loose trowsers, and was provided with a china basin, some
      phials, and a napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, &ldquo;for our operations. Dominique, assist this
      gentleman, remove his coat, and bare his shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro obeyed, and I submitted to examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, you have made little ado about what might have been a
      serious injury. Your back and arms are extensively contused, the whole
      surface is bruised, and the skin discoloured. Come, we shall take a little
      blood, and then embrocate the parts affected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt inclined to demur against submitting to phlebotomy, but mine was no
      common doctor. The negro bound my arm, produced a lancet, opened a vein
      with great adroitness, while his master overlooked the operation, until he
      thought that I had lost a sufficiency of blood. After a copious depletion,
      Dominique lubricated my back with some oily substance; and, having
      ascertained that all was correctly done, he assisted me to bed; while his
      master bade me a friendly good night, quitted the room, and both left me
      &ldquo;alone in my glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a &ldquo;whirligig world&rdquo; we live in! I was but one day fairly flown upon
      it, and what a medley of adventure had it not produced! In the morning,
      starting full of &ldquo;gay hope,&rdquo; and for the first time master of myself; in
      the evening, captive of a gang of ruffians, who, in drunken barbarity,
      would have consigned me to the bottom of the lake, with less compunction
      than that with which a school-boy drowns a kitten. At night, inmate of a
      strange mansion, doubtfully received, half rejected afterwards, and now
      domesticated, as if I had been undoubted heir to every barren hill in
      view. All this was passing strange; and, lost &ldquo;in wild conjecture,&rdquo; and
      unable to read riddles, I betook myself quietly to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be faith in strong exercise, a deep potation, and bruised bones,
      I ought to have slept soundly,&mdash;and so I did; dreaming nevertheless
      of nuns and corsairs, smugglers and sacks, wild ducks, burgundy,
      bloodletting, and Heaven knows what besides, until a gentle touch upon the
      shoulder dispelled these troublous visions, and showed, by the misty light
      of a dull October morning, the well-remembered features of my kind and
      mysterious host, standing at my bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you rested well?&rdquo; said the deep voice of Mr. Hartley, in the
      gracious tones it could occasionally assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have slept most soundly; and find myself so far recovered from bruise
      and battery, that I could&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run anew the gauntlet as a gauger, and take the broken bridge, in
      stroke,&rdquo; added mine host, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall not put you to the test to-day; you must keep quiet; at
      least, so says Dominique, your leech. Do you wish to read? you will find
      books. Would you write? there are materials in the drawing-room. Would you
      shoot&mdash;swim&mdash;sail? Here are all facilities. Your mare is in my
      stable, your cloak-case honestly restored; and, as the stranger avowed who
      brought them hither, the steed uninjured and your effects untouched. I
      have received important letters, which for a few hours oblige me to leave
      home. Before supper you may count upon my return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him warmly for the kind manner in which he pressed my further
      stay, but hinted that the time was limited within which I must report
      myself at head-quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know you must be in Dublin on the 24th; but this
      is only the 20th. I will send you off to-morrow,&mdash;sounder in bones,
      and safer in property, than when you honoured me with a visit.&lsquo;Tis
      scarcely six o&rsquo;clock. Sleep till Dominique appears. Addio! One word more,&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      cautionary,&mdash;we were introduced but yesterday; to-day makes or mars
      our friendship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could reply, he glided from the chamber, closed the door softly,
      and left me to sleep or wake, just as I pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt little inclination to court the &ldquo;drowsy influence&rdquo; of my pillow;
      for the stranger&rsquo;s parting words, like every thing about him, were a
      mystery. Accordingly, I rose, threw aside the curtains, and let as much
      light in as an overcast morning would admit through a lattice dimmed with
      mist and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yet but seven, and some time must elapse before the family would be
      afoot. Out of doors, all looked cold and comfortless, and I was obliged to
      betake myself to bed again, and there await patiently the advent of my
      sable physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep I could not; my brain was in a whirl, as the events of yesterday
      crossed my mind in fast succession; all, or any, being sufficiently
      exciting to stamp the day adventurous to a novice like myself, just
      started on the world. But one engrossing recollection obliterated all the
      rest, and the picture and supper-scene occupied my thoughts exclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I pondered on the singular resemblance between the figures in the
      painting and those of Isidora and &ldquo;mine host,&rdquo; my eyes involuntarily
      rested on the arms which hung above the mantel-pieee. The sabre and
      pistols rivetted my attention. They were the very identical weapons with
      which the corsair in the picture was accoutred! Hartley&rsquo;s eulogy upon the
      sword, and the boast of his former prowess, confirmed the belief, that
      though a &ldquo;worthy Thane&rdquo; at present, there was a period when his calling
      was but indifferent, and himself, &ldquo;if a man should speak truly, little
      better than one of the wicked.&rdquo; Just then I heard a gentle tap, and
      Dominique made his appearance to ascertain how far I had benefited by his
      leech-craft, and if necessary, to assist me at my toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master, Dominique, went early abroad to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He had business at some short distance from the house, but he
      will not delay long. How much better your wounds look than could have been
      expected from their appearance last night!&rdquo; and the negro embrocated my
      bruises again. &ldquo;Pray, do you know, sir, any of the persons who assailed
      you on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, in faith. From what I can collect, I was mistaken for another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bad blunder for you; but, all considered, you have escaped
      wonderfully. It was very doubtful whether you could have left your room
      this morning; and Miss Isidora begs to know whether you will have
      breakfast in your chamber, or venture to the parlour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the parlour, certainly.&rdquo; Up I sprang, dressed rapidly, and following
      the sable functionary to the end of the corridor; he pointed to the
      drawing-room door, bowed, left me, and I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was still untenanted, and, to all appearance, precisely as I had
      left it the preceding night. Reckless of the confusion it had already
      caused, I determined to satisfy my curiosity again, and take a second peep
      at the mysterious picture. From the doorway the massive frame was visible,
      for my eyes had turned involuntarily to the place where my thoughts had
      already wandered. I walked on and stood before the painting.&lsquo;Twas passing
      strange; there was the frame, but both lady and corsair had vanished; and
      the parting scene of love had changed to one of vengeance. How opposite
      the subject, too&mdash;Blue Beard about to shorten Fatima by the head, for
      being over curious, like myself, in a strange house and on a first visit.
      Was this pointed as a hint to me? I&rsquo;faith, it looked very like it, but,
      before I could determine whether the painting was designed to convey this
      silent lesson, a light step behind announced the presence of Isidora. She
      had entered from the adjoining room unperceived, and came to tell me that
      breakfast waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things considered, the meal passed over with less embarrassment than
      might have been expected from a <i>tête à tête</i> between two novices
      like us, who had parted in the unpromising manner we had done the night
      before. Although timid as one unacquainted with the world will naturally
      be when she is first addressed by a stranger, Isidora&rsquo;s was the diffidence
      of maiden modesty rather than <i>mauvais honte</i>; while I, appertaining
      to that numerous class intituled &ldquo;bashful Irishmen,&rdquo; mustered my small
      stock of assurance, as I whispered to myself old Chapman&rsquo;s lines&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ah! crrared sheep&rsquo;s-head, hast thou liv&rsquo;d thus long,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And dar&rsquo;st not look a woman in the face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain it is, that, after having duly ascertained that my mare and
      baggage had passed through the hands of the Philistines uninjured, I
      returned gallantly to the drawing-room. There I behaved as a soldier of
      promise should do; ending by proposing a walk to the fair hostess, which
      invitation on her part was gracefully accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had improved considerably; and we strolled arm-in-arm to the brow
      of a small hill, which, rising boldly above the copse that encircled it,
      commanded a splendid view of a spacious lake, with woodlands in the
      foreground and mountains in the distance. This was a favourite spot, and
      frequently, as my companion told me, visited by herself and Mr. Hartley.
      We placed ourselves on a rustic bench under the shading of a fine old elm;
      and, while I could not but admire the romantic scenery that everywhere met
      the eye, I marvelled that one who had mingled in the world, and had ample
      means to do so&mdash;as all about his domicile inferred&mdash;should
      seclude the young beauty beside me in a wilderness, fitted for men only of
      lawless habits and broken fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not, at times, find this place solitary, Miss Hartley?&rdquo; I asked,
      in a careless tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is retired, certainly; but I have been accustomed from my childhood to
      retirement,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but one who has been in the world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would, no doubt, find this mansion disagreeable. I have been secluded
      from infancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For fifteen years I never set my foot beyond the convent garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you intended for a <i>religieuse?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, seclude you from the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cloister is surely the best asylum for those who need protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lost your mother when young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To judge by its effect on my fair companion, the allusion was particularly
      unfortunate. The cheek, &ldquo;but feebly touched with red&rdquo; just now, flushed,
      and told that I had committed a fresh indiscretion. By a sudden impulse I
      seized her hand:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I again offended? Alas, Miss Hartley, I am inexcusable! But, as it
      was perfectly unintentional, may I once more entreat forgiveness?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; exclaimed the deep voice of my host, as, to our mutual
      astonishment and dismay, he stepped from the thicket. In confusion, I
      dropped his daughter&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, young sir, what may be the offending which required such earnest
      supplication to be pardoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An impertinent question,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeat it,&rdquo; he continued, as he fixed his eye steadily on mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inquired whether Miss Hartley had not been designed to take the veil,
      that for so long a period of her life she had lived the inmate of a
      convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a silly and a harmless question,&rdquo; he answered drily. &ldquo;Know you not
      that it is customary in catholic countries to entrust the daughters of the
      noblest families to religious communities for instruction? Well, Isidora,
      the pardon may be granted: for it is, possibly, the last offending he
      shall perpetrate or you forgive. Come, my girl, dinner has been ordered
      two hours earlier than usual, to enable Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran to proceed this
      evening on his route. This may sound inhospitable, sir, but it is
      necessary. Isidora, let us look upon that lake, and these mountains: we
      look upon them for the last time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started. What did all this mean? I looked at Mr. Hartley, but his face
      wore the same expression it always did; and if on the tablet of memory the
      past and present were fast careering, the volume was sealed to me. Dinner
      was served: it was a hurried and unsocial meal; and when the cloth was
      lifted, Isidora left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, sir,&rdquo; said the host&mdash;&ldquo;time flies; and in half an hour <i>you</i>
      will be on the road, and <i>I</i> preparing for a longer journey. Those
      pistols on the table are yours. Fearing lest they had suffered by the
      night air, I had them discharged and cleaned.&rdquo; He got up, took the
      weapons, and examined them critically. &ldquo;From the cypher, I presume them to
      have been your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He sprang the ramrods&mdash;&ldquo;Clean and
      effective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In travelling, there are two things I never delegate
      to another&mdash;my horse and my weapons. The first I see attended to
      before myself; and the second, I take especial care shall not be found
      wanting when required. You will find ammunition in that drawer, and I beg
      you to excuse me for five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, I reloaded my pistols&mdash;filled another glass of wine&mdash;wondered
      what the devil would come next&mdash;heard the door open&mdash;looked
      round, and saw mine host leading his fair daughter in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isidora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;comes to bid you farewell. I overheard you ask pardon
      for some imaginary offending, and she will confirm it. My love, give the
      gentleman that ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In deep confusion, the blushing girl pulled a jewel from her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, love&mdash;a diamond would be ill suited for the hand that
      in a brief space may be cold upon a battle-field.&lsquo;Twould be to gorge with
      treasure they could not estimate, the human vultures which follow to
      batten on kindred carrion. No love, that other. It is, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, the
      trophy of an early adventure&mdash;a simple hoop of gold&mdash;pure as it
      comes from the mine. As a remembrance, rich as if it had issued from
      Golconda&mdash;and as a bauble valueless, and therefore the fitter for a
      soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isidora placed the keepsake on my finger, and with my lips I pressed her
      trembling hand. Her father gave a signal&mdash;and she hastily left the
      room by one door, as the blue-coated attendant entered by another to say
      that &ldquo;my horse was waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will attend you to the gate,&rdquo; said my host; and we proceeded down the
      long corridor together. At the entrance I found my mare, full of life and
      fit for any thing. Blue-coat housed my pistols in the holsters, Mr.
      Hartley squeezed my hand, and I sprang into the saddle, muttering thanks,
      which mine host returned with something like a blessing. He turned towards
      the door&mdash;I rode round the angle of the court-yard. Casting my eyes
      back I took a last look at the house, and from an upper window a white arm
      waved its parting farewell. Who sent that mute addio?&mdash;who&mdash;but
      Isidora!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s I rode from Mr.
      Hartley&rsquo;s, I could scarcely persuade myself that the transactions of the
      last two days were aught but a coinage of the brain, and took the liberty
      of respectfully inquiring of myself whether I were actually <i>compos
      mentis</i>. As I looked around, I received on this point a mute
      affirmative. I was sitting in mine own saddle&mdash;bestrode the best mare
      that ever cleared a broken bridge&mdash;identified the holsters at my
      pommel&mdash;my cloak-bag was duly secured upon its pad&mdash;and,
      stronger proof, &ldquo;a gay gold ring&rdquo; glittered on my finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sweet September evening, and for the first mile or two the
      scenery harmonized well with that hour &ldquo;which poets love.&rdquo; But when the
      natural wood that encircled Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s domain was left behind, I found
      before me a large expanse of dull brown moorland, which must be traversed
      before I could reach the solitary house where I purposed to take up my
      quarters for the night. The inn was ten miles distant, and the gentle
      reader will please to hold in recollection, that these miles were Irish
      miles; therefore, had I been inclined to sentimentalize, there was neither
      time nor place for musing. I gave Miss Malone accordingly permission to
      step out; and as the sun made his parting bow from behind a mountain
      ridge, I pulled up at the Yellow Lion and received an honourable welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing at the door, Andy Beg appeared as if he had been for some time in
      waiting. He held a letter in his hand, and had a gun-case under his arm.
      Having grinned what he intended to be a civil recognition, he took my
      pistols and cloak bag, and led the way into this mountain caravansera. If
      for me the fatted calf had not been killed, still preparations had been
      made for supper&mdash;for a Nora Crina sort of cook, in short petticoats
      and a gown curiously tucked up, crossed me in the passage with a brace of
      moor-fowls ready for the brander. Miss Malone was stabled as became her
      worth&mdash;and I duly inducted into a cheerful chamber, the &ldquo;great one&rdquo;
       of the Yellow Lion, and evidently reserved for honourable guests. Having
      seated myself before the fire, I broke the seal of the packet which Andy
      Beg had delivered, and found it to be a valedictory epistle from that
      mysterious personage, Mr. Hartley. The letter ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our acquaintance has commenced under such singular circumstances that I
      trace in it the hand of destiny&mdash;for chance could not have thus
      brought us together, when to meet was every thing but impossible. In me,
      know one who influences your fortunes&mdash;one, who by a breath can
      confer or withhold what men erroneously consider the passport to human
      happiness&mdash;wealth! For the future, I shall watch your career, and
      every action of your life shall be under a rigid <i>surveillance</i>. Be
      prudent, and I promise you a goodly independence. Disappoint my hopes, and
      you never see me more. To suppose that youth will not err occasionally,
      would be to plead ignorance of what mankind is. But remember, for folly
      there is pardon&mdash;for vice none. May you pass the ordeal unscathed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is secure against the frowns of fortune; and it may be decreed
      that you shall not escape. Mark me, boy! When friends fall off, the future
      is overcast, and all around seems desperate, write freely&mdash;let
      nothing be held back&mdash;and even in that heavy hour I may step between
      you and your fate. The address I enclose will always find me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell; Isidora sends a kind remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, as you conduct yourself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Hartley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;You admired a gun of Manton&rsquo;s; I beg you to accept it. You can
      safely forward it to Dublin by the stage coach which passes the inn
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another postscript was annexed: it commanded me to keep profoundly secret
      my recent escapade among the smugglers, as well as my subsequent
      introduction to this my most mysterious correspondent. To this strange
      epistle, I returned a dutiful reply; and having despatched Andy Beg with
      my letter, I supped&mdash;went to sleep&mdash;and dreamed till cockcrow of
      the strange <i>dramatis personae</i> who had figured so prominently in my
      late adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth evening I reached the metropolis in safety&mdash;reported
      myself next morning to the Colonel&mdash;obtained a barrack-room in
      George&rsquo;s-street&mdash;was introduced to my brother officers, and committed
      duly to be drilled. I mounted the &ldquo;red-rag&rdquo;&mdash;and satisfied myself by
      a sly inspection as I passed every hatter&rsquo;s shop, from the effigy of the
      great King William even unto Stephen&rsquo;s Green, that the jacket was accurate
      in its proportions, and conferred immortal honour upon the builder of the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among some introductory letters, one had been given me by my father,
      addressed to a respectable merchant to whom he annually consigned his
      wool. His name was Pryme&mdash;he lived on one of the quays, was reputed
      to be very wealthy, and was a rigid quaker. When I called at his
      counting-house I found that he had been absent for a day or two, and was
      gone to the country on business; but from his son I received much civility
      and any information that I required. The young quaker was a little older
      than I, but in height and general appearance singularly like me. Indeed,
      we might have passed for twin brothers, had not the cut and colour of our
      garments announced that no relationship could exist between a flashy
      flanker and a sober youth, whose conversation and outer man told plainly
      that he had eschewed the pomps and vanities of this wicked world.
      According to my father&rsquo;s orders, Mr. Pryme was not only to supply me with
      good advice, but also to furnish me with money when required&mdash;and one
      fine evening the young quaker, after mess, visited my barrack-room, and
      then and there replenished a treasury which a military outfit had nearly
      exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he was hospitably entertained. The bottle passed freely&mdash;some
      of the younger hands dropped in&mdash;the kettle was put in requisition&mdash;and
      it was decreed that whisky punch should complete what port wine had
      handsomely commenced already.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock the party were regularly screwed, the quaker worse than
      any. We had indulged in divers drunken freaks; and not the least
      ridiculous was an interchange of clothes between me and Simon Pure. Our
      next proceeding was to seek adventure, and sally forth upon the town; I
      attired in a snuff-coloured single-breasted coatee and broad-brimmed hat,
      and brother Samuel in full regimentals and a bearskin chaco.

    <p>
      Our career was short and brilliant. We managed to get up a row in
      Dame-street with a party of college men, bent on the same errand as
      ourselves. The watch interfered&mdash;we joined our quondam opponents in a
      treaty, offensive and defensive, to resist this impertinent intervention,
      and the fight for a short time was respectably maintained. But numbers
      succeeded. I was stretched <i>hors de combat</i>; sundry belligerents (the
      quaker included) were captured and carried to the watch-house, while the
      remainder, reserving themselves for deeds of valour on a future day,
      levanted, and left us to our fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either owing to the severity of the blow, or from the shock of the fall,
      after having saluted my mother earth I lay perfectly motionless; while,
      alarmed at this proof of prowess, instead of conveying me to durance vile,
      the guardians of the night, declaring me dead as Julius Cæsar, carried me
      into a neighbouring apothecary&rsquo;s, to ascertain whether that disciple of
      the healing god could minister to mortal wounds, and set defunct gentlemen
      safe upon their legs again. The doctor having wiped and mounted his
      spectacles, proceeded to what he believed would turn out a <i>post mortem</i>
      examination; for after a single glance, he started back and exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ye villans&mdash;every sowl of ye will be hanged! Haven&rsquo;t ye
      murdered a quaker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; responded the commander of the faithful. &ldquo;Sure it was the
      quaker that murdered us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done, ye scoundrels! He&rsquo;s a man of peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pace or war,&rdquo; returned a watchman, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the hardest hitter betune this
      and Bully&rsquo;s acre, and that&rsquo;s a big word. He give me one clip wid the left
      hand, and jist look at my eye, af ye plase. By this book,&rdquo; and Charlie
      reverently held up his lantern, &ldquo;I think it was the crown of my head that
      first titched the gravel. It was the clanest knock down I ivir got&mdash;and
      many&rsquo;s the floorer I&rsquo;ve had in my time from thim college divils. Bad luck
      attind them night and day&mdash;the thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who <i>is</i> the gentleman?&rdquo; inquired the apothecary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah! sorra one of us knows,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search his pockets,&rdquo; said the leech;&mdash;&ldquo;some paper will probably
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quaker&rsquo;s coatee forthwith underwent a judicial investigation, and
      divers mercantile documents at once established the identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the apothecary, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s son of Mr. Pryme, the rich merchant, a
      man whom every body respects. By my conscience, I have one comfort for ye.
      If any thing goes wrong with the boy here, every man Jack of ye is sure of
      Botany Bay&mdash;ay! and the devil a rap it will cost any of ye for the
      passage out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;murder! murder!&rdquo; ejaculated sundry voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whish&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the doctor, for I gave a twist upon the floor, and
      muttered&mdash;&ldquo;Fill fair, and be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Bridget!&rdquo; ejaculated the chief of the Charlies&mdash;&ldquo;if ivir I met
      a quaker of his kind. He drinks like a fish, and swears like a trooper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! he&rsquo;s coming round again,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;See!&mdash;the
      colour&rsquo;s on his cheek. I tell you what you&rsquo;ll do. Call a chair, carry him
      home fur and asy; and, if ye can, smuggle him down the area steps, for the
      ould gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t be overpleased to see him. I&rsquo;ll drop the lad a
      line or two in the morning, and make all right for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a charlie trotted off, and in a few minutes I was safely
      ensconced in a &ldquo;leathern conveniency&rdquo; now extinct, which at that time
      performed a double duty in transporting beauty to the ball-room, and
      drunkards to their cribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was promptly conveyed to my destination; and, by some strange fatality,
      a new chief butler that very evening had succeeded the former &ldquo;pantler&rdquo; of
      Mr. Pryme. I was, of course, personally unknown to&rsquo; him; and having been
      discreetly slipped down the area steps, it was explained that &ldquo;I was
      rather the worse of liquor, and had been mighty pugnacious into the
      bargain.&rdquo; The butler took me on his back; and without let or hindrance, I
      was carried to the chamber of the absent Samuel&mdash;stripped&mdash;put
      to bed,&mdash;promised a bowl of whey&mdash;and left in undisputed
      possession of the dormitory of the drunken quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three hours passed; and how the secret transpired I cannot guess. I
      was buried in profound sleep, when lights, flashed across my eyes and
      awakened me. Through an opening in the curtains I saw three females beside
      the bed; and I also discovered that the apartment was a strange one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise or fear will sometimes remove the consequences of inebriety, and
      men become suddenly sober. I felt this singular effect. In a moment after
      I awoke, I was conscious that I had been lately a victim to &ldquo;the rosy
      god,&rdquo; and that I was now, in Irish parlance, &ldquo;just in the very centre of a
      hobble.&rdquo; Dipping my face beneath the counterpane, I murmured in a growling
      voice&mdash;&ldquo;The lights! the lights! my head, my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; said the elder female, &ldquo;remove the candles. Samuel! my son, what
      meaneth this? Art thou fallen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I groaned; &ldquo;I had a heavy fall, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Samuel&mdash;would that that groan were the groan of sin, and not of
      suffering; and that thy conscience rather than thy stomach were moved.
      Speak! How did the enemy overtake thee? Where did he enclose thee in his
      net?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dipped my head beneath the bed coverings, and, in a husky voice,
      muttered&mdash;&ldquo;The barracks in George&rsquo;s-street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us!&mdash;Ruth&mdash;Rachel. It is the large brick building in
      which abide godless men in scarlet. And how, Samuel, did the evil one
      achieve thy fall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One said I was floored by a charlie, and another left it upon a clip from
      a blackthorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Samuel; I ask the carnal means. Was it by that soul-destroying
      liquor, wine, or was it by worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, worse,&rdquo; I mumbled in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Pryme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; responded the gentle Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alack, alack! continued the conscientious Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name the snare of the tempter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too bashful,&rdquo; I grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, Samuel. Close thy ears, Ruth&mdash;avert thy head, Rachel; he would
      not have his shame revealed. Was it, Samuel, a dancing Herodias&mdash;or
      some Delilah, with bewitching looks!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; worse, worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us! Speak, and name the fatal cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punch&mdash;punch!&mdash;Whisky new&mdash;the kettle not boiled&mdash;and
      too much acid,&rdquo; came grumbling from below the blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fearful is inebriety! Thy very voice, my son, is changed. But verily,
      as it is thy first offending, I will pardon it, and give thee the kiss of
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she popped her head through the curtains, and bestowed upon me
      the reconciliatory <i>accolade</i>. After thus sealing my pardon, the
      worthy gentlewoman sailed out of the apartment, accompanied by her
      handmaid Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself in a curious position,&mdash;located in a strange house,
      ensconced in a comfortable bed from which the right owner would presently
      eject me, and watched by a lovely girl of eighteen, on whose sweet
      countenance the very imprint of innocence was stamped. And what was I?&mdash;A
      regular impostor. Well, what was to be done? Should I admit my villany,
      and be bundled off direct to Newgate, under a charge of burglary, or some
      more felonious intentions? And to whom was this interesting confession to
      be made? The old dame?&mdash;no, faith&mdash;there no kiss of peace would
      ratify my pardon. The young one?&mdash;pshaw, the very idea that she had
      been seated beside the bed of a man in scarlet would annihilate Rachel on
      the spot. No doubt a discovery must ensue&mdash;but, like every thing a
      man dislikes, I determined to procrastinate it and trust to fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samuel,&rdquo; said the sweetest voice imaginable, &ldquo;does thy head ache? Let me
      apply this essence and passing her hand gently through the curtains, she
      bathed my temples with <i>eau-de-Cologne</i>. My arm was outside the
      coverlid,&mdash;she took my hand in hers and pressed it affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How feverish!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But here comes Ruth, with something our
      mother sends, which will allay thy thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stiff-backed abigail deposited the liquid on a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Rachel, sleep will restore thy brother.&rdquo; Then addressing herself to
      me, &ldquo;Farewell, friend Samuel,&mdash;may this be the last of thy
      foolishness and after this flattering admonition, she exited from the
      chamber, stiff as a ramrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, dear brother,&rdquo;&mdash;and Rachel again clasped my hand in hers,&mdash;&ldquo;good
      night! I trust sincerely I shall find thee better in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I mumbled. &ldquo;Rachel, <i>dear,&mdash;dear</i> Rachel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;the kiss of peace!&rdquo; I managed to stammer from beneath
      the bed coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, dear Samuel;&rdquo; and lips, &ldquo;full, rosy, ripe,&rdquo; were artlessly
      pressed to mine, while a prayer, pure from a guileless heart, implored
      pardon for the past, and a blessing for the future. The next moment the
      door was softly closed, and I &ldquo;left alone in my glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Would it be credited that under such circumstances had the audacity to
      sleep? But sleep I did&mdash;and when I slept, my head was on a peaceful
      pillow, and the kiss of innocence still fragrant on my lips.

      CHAPTER VIII. LIFE IN A WATCH-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er be drunk while I live again but in honest, civil, godly
      company, for this trick; if I be drunk, I&rsquo;ll be drunk with those that have
      the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.&rdquo;&mdash;Merry Wives of
      Windsor. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eader,&mdash;will
      you make a clean breast and answer a simple question?&mdash;Were you ever
      regularly cribbed, and deposited for safe keeping in a watch-house? Don&rsquo;t
      confound places, and suppose for a moment, that I mean those <i>réfugia
      peccatorum</i>, now-a-days called &ldquo;station-houses.&rdquo; The two are no more
      alike, than the London Tavern is to a boiled-beef shop. If you reply to my
      inquiry in the negative, and art young, I can only say the mischief is
      irremediable&mdash;and for the best reason, because watch-houses have been
      defunct these twenty years. If, like myself, you are a gentleman of a
      certain age, and also plead ignorance&mdash;you have nothing left but to
      mourn over misspent time, and lament a misfortune, for which no one is
      blamable but yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a jovial hour have I passed in St. Andrews&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean the
      Scotch College so called, but the Dublin watch-house of pleasant memory;
      and I have also occasionally favoured with a visit other establishments of
      the same kind, where belated gentlemen were sure to find the door open
      without having the trouble of knocking twice:&mdash;but who, except &ldquo;upon
      compulsion,&rdquo; would enter a modern bastile? The place is in everything an
      abomination, and so republican wherewithal in its regulations, as to be
      fitted only for the reception of the <i>canaille</i>. There, captains and
      cabmen are placed upon a par. &ldquo;Look to him, jailer,&rdquo; is the only order
      that is attended to; and whether you belong to swells West-end, or the
      swell-mob, matters not a brass button. The thing&rsquo;s similar all through,
      and you undergo the same process of purification. You are cooped up all
      night, thermometer in summer 110, in winter down to zero&mdash;and bundled
      before the Beak in the morning all &ldquo;unkempt&rdquo; and with &ldquo;marvellous foul
      linen.&rdquo; Of course, you are not flat enough to give your real name. If you
      are a tradesman, why you wish to &ldquo;come it genteel,&rdquo; and pass for the time
      being as Mr. Ferdinand Fitzsnooks. If, on the contrary, you happen to be a
      &ldquo;top-sawyer,&rdquo; you descend from your &ldquo;high estate,&rdquo; and&mdash;though &ldquo;Baron
      or Squire, or Knight of the Shire,&rdquo;&mdash;adopt &ldquo;for the nonce,&rdquo; the
      simpler appellation of Smith, Brown, or Robinson. Well, in due course, you
      are favoured with a hearing&mdash;the charges are proven, and the Worthy
      Magistrate&mdash;he&rsquo;s always so termed in the Sunday papers&mdash;runs you
      up a bill as glibly as the waitress of an eating-house. Imprimis, you are
      scored down five shillings for being drunk&mdash;forty ditto, for assault
      and battery&mdash;as much more for jingling some Doctor&rsquo;s bell&mdash;and
      the tale ends in your five-pound flimsy having got a regular sickener. You
      fork the money out, and prepare directly to make your exit; but hold, you
      are not safe yet&mdash;wait for the parting admonition. Beaky having first
      premised that your name is neither Smith, Brown, nor Robinson, is sorry to
      assure you that he considers you a disgrace to your family and order&mdash;and,
      after a flattering panegyric upon his own nice sense of what is due to
      public justice, he concludes with a positive assurance, that if you ever
      renew your acquaintance with him, so far from standing &ldquo;betwixt the wind
      and your nobility,&rdquo; you shall have the benefit of a month&rsquo;s exercise on
      the tread-mill, &ldquo;and no mistake.&rdquo; And now comes Mr. Ferdinand Fitzsnooks.
      He stands forward&mdash;but how different is his bearing from that of the
      pseudo Mr. Smith, who has just jumped into a cab in waiting, with coronets
      emblazoned on the panels. He does not listen to the charges with
      inattention; nor does he venture to meet the magistrate&rsquo;s eye, as it
      occasionally is turned to that part of the court where he stands. He has
      been silly and noisy and riotous&mdash;but he has done no mischief. He is
      found guilty, and fined three pounds. The pale girl behind him&mdash;she
      with the infant in her arms&mdash;begins to sob, while Ferdinand appeals
      to the bench, and on the plea of a first offence, solicits a remission of
      the penalty. But Rhadamanthus is not sterner than his judge. Pshaw! worthy
      sir, let him go! he is but a drudge in a lawyer&rsquo;s office&mdash;his master
      is strict&mdash;he will lose his situation, and what will that pale girl
      and her infant do? No; the upright magistrate is obdurate&mdash;and the
      slang of what &ldquo;justice requires&rdquo; is his only answer to the prisoner&rsquo;s
      appeal. The jailer, a filthy, dogged, drunken, red-nosed brute, taps him
      on the shoulder and inquires, in pickpocket parlance, whether he can
      &ldquo;stump the rowdy?&rdquo; A melancholy shake of the head tells his inability, and
      he is committed for&mdash;what?&mdash;want of money&mdash;to the House of
      Correction for a fortnight. Worthy sir&mdash;pause before you send that
      silly young man to prison. Look at his wife&mdash;she is barely eighteen&mdash;young,
      pretty, and inexperienced. She has not a relative in London,&mdash;and
      steeped in poverty and surrounded with temptations, will you rob her for
      fourteen days of her protector, because he cannot command three
      sovereigns? True, you fined Mr. Smith two pounds more, and also talked
      something about the tread-mill&mdash;but, for your very life, you would
      not have ventured to commit him. I could show you Mr. Smith&rsquo;s name in the
      peerage&mdash;ay, and high up, too; and he could have as easily given you
      a cheque upon his bankers for five thousand, as he handed you the penalty
      of five pounds. And this is law!&mdash;England, England! you call yourself
      the land of freedom!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what has all this to do with your story? Reader,&mdash;I beg your
      pardon, and thank you for the hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hatch of St. Andrew&rsquo;s watch-house&mdash;a sort of outer-door, only
      breast-high, but furnished with a row of iron spikes which would bid
      defiance to Harlequin himself&mdash;was closed&mdash;and, a very unusual
      occurrence at that late hour, all within the house of durance was quiet.
      Peter Bradley, the captain of the hold, was seated on a wooden bench in
      his accustomed corner, with a little table before him, on which was
      awfully displayed the fatal book in which delinquencies were chronicled,
      flanked by a pewter vessel full charged with Sweetman&rsquo;s XXX. Three
      guardians of the night, who formed the jail-guard, sate round the fire
      &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; a comfortable <i>dudheine</i>, and casting, from time to time, a
      longing eye at the battered quart deposited beside the elbow of the
      commander. There were other occupants&mdash;for occasionally melancholy
      faces peeped through a grated wicket in the door, which separated the
      dungeon-keep from the guard-room,&mdash;and from their place of captivity
      looked anxiously at the great man seated in the corner, whose nod could
      loose or bind. Indeed the task of watch and ward was easy, for the
      prisoners were comprised in one solitary group, namely&mdash;a drunken
      sailor, a fiddler with one leg, and &ldquo;a maid who loved the moon,&rdquo; brought
      there for fading through a shop-window and making <i>smithereens</i> of
      divers panes of glass, for which, as, from a lack of the king&rsquo;s currency,
      they could make no proper compensation, they were safely incarcerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Bradley nibbed his pen, laid down his spectacles, gave a heavy sigh,
      and then, as if to kill care, took a long and steady pull from the pewter.
      &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; said the commander, addressing himself to his myrmidons at the
      fire, &ldquo;business is gone to the dogs.&lsquo;Tis twelve o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; he continued, as
      the wooden time-piece above his head announced the &ldquo;witching hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock! and not a sowl picked up but devils who couldn&rsquo;t muster,
      if it saved them from the gallows, turnpike-money for a walking-stick. Out
      with them varmint in the black-hole, Barney Casey; what use in shuttin&rsquo; up
      craters without a <i>scultogue</i>, * and lumbrin the place wid people who
      can&rsquo;t stand a pint of beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;<i>Seultogue</i>, is a monetary phrase, used generally in the
     kingdom of Connaught. Its metallic value not being clearly
     ascertained, I have doubts whether it would be a legal
     tender.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Extract from an opinion of Mr. Richard Dunn, the
     eminent barrister</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Barney, obedient to the orders of his chief, made a general jail delivery.
      The nymph as she glided out, acknowledged the favour conferred by dropping
      a graceful curtsey as she passed &ldquo;the seat of justice;&rdquo; the fiddler as he
      hopped across the floor, dutifully ducked his head, and bade a &ldquo;good night
      to his Honour;&rdquo; but the sailor, reckless of the merciful interposition
      which had restored him to liberty, and freed him from all liability
      incurred for broken glass, consigned all and every in the watch-house to a
      climate much hotter than the West Indies, for which ungrateful and
      irreligious proceeding, he received a momentum in the door-way which
      enabled him, &ldquo;in double quick,&rdquo; to reach the opposite curb-stone. The
      hatch was thereupon safely locked, and Mr. Bradley again addressed his
      brother officials:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more beside that&rsquo;s vexin&rsquo; me, boys. I hear they are goin&rsquo; to
      overhawl us&mdash;and sorra a turn, good or bad, that happens through the
      night, but must be entered in black and white. Feaks! I thought myself
      yesterday, that something was in the wind, for the magistrates were as
      short with me as cat&rsquo;s-hair; and that divil, Artur French, was nearly
      hobblin&rsquo; me fairly. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s this Artur French?&rsquo; says Mr. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, then,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s himself that&rsquo;s a raal gintleman. Sure, wasn&rsquo;t
      his father Ulick French, of French Hall, and his mother&rsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me about his mother,&rsquo; says he,
      mad as a hatter; &lsquo;Who is he? what is he?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A collegian, plase ye&rsquo;r
      honour.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ay, and a promising disciple he is, if I may judge,&rsquo; says
      he, &lsquo;by your watch-book. Why, he&rsquo;s wid ye, Mr. Bradley, three times a
      week. The next time he pays you a visit, I beg you&rsquo;ll be good enough to
      introduce him to me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth; and ye won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; observed one of the guard of honour at the
      fire-place, as he leisurely recharged his <i>dudheine</i>; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll blarney
      ye, and git away wid the ould story of both ye&rsquo;r mothers being Roscommon
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the Lord would send in a dacent customer, any how, that could pay
      his way,&rdquo; said a second charlie: &ldquo;if iver I was drier in my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks!&rdquo; observed the third, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s myself that has got a cobweb in my
      throat. But, whisht! boys&mdash;look out there! Who knows our luck yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up jumped one of the smokers, and craning his head over the hatch,
      communicated the gratifying intelligence that the patrol were coming up
      with divers delinquents in close custody. The charlies pocketed their
      pipes, Mr. Bradley mounted his spectacles, while the shuffling of feet,
      and an uproar of many voices talking and arguing at their highest pitch,
      joined to the maudlin singing of a noisy drunkard, announced the immediate
      approach of a detachment of a body whom poor Burns dreaded and denounced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That black banditti&mdash;the city guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; said the charlie at the hatch: &ldquo;one man in red, either
      dead or dead drunk&mdash;three shy-looking scamps behind him&mdash;and a
      regular swell in front. Blessed Bridget! is it him? Be the hole in my
      coat, that&rsquo;s yourself, Artur French, if ye&rsquo;r ovir ground. May the davil
      welcome you, <i>astore!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if it is,&rdquo; said the irritated commandant, &ldquo;Artur French, you&rsquo;ll have
      a new acquaintance in the morning, before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistake in the identity. A young man dressed in the extreme
      of fashion pushed through the watchmen with an air of authority, and
      hopping on the bench where Mr. Bradley had hitherto reposed his person in
      solitary dignity, seated himself, unbidden, beside this dreaded
      functionary, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;for no inviting did he wait,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      but seized the sacred pewter, and drained the contents to the very bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How thirsty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a shindy makes one! Not bad stuff that, Peter.
      But, governor, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. French looked steadily in
      Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s face, which had assumed what was intended to pass for an
      expression of dignified displeasure. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not as sour as a Seville
      orange to-night! Come, come, old chap, tip us your daddle&mdash;give us a
      grip of your bunch of fives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bradley held back his hand. &ldquo;I tell ye what, Artur&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
      after vexin&rsquo; me&mdash;I&rsquo;m in bad temper to-night&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll stand no
      gammon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand your granny!&rdquo; returned the young <i>roué</i>; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what
      I&rsquo;ll stand&mdash;and that&rsquo;s more to the purpose. Broiled kidneys, black
      cockles, a gallon of heavy wet, and as much punch as you can swim in. Off
      with ye to Nosey McKeown&rsquo;s,&rdquo;&mdash;and crumpling up a pound note, he
      pitched it into a watchman&rsquo;s face,&mdash;&ldquo;See that all comes in hot; and
      take care that his daughter Sibby brews the punch. Now, Peter, try and
      look pleasant. An&rsquo;t I better to you than a bad stepson?&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      punched the commander&rsquo;s ribs unceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah&mdash;Artur, have done, will ye? What the divil druv ye here the
      night, good or bad?&rdquo; asked the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I fancy you have named the gentleman that did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, what brought ye here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a score of your scoundrels, Peter. I fell over that cursed fellow in
      the red jacket sleeping on the guard bed&mdash;and before I could get
      fairly on my pins, these villains had me fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing else for it&mdash;you must go before Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jones may go to Bath; but before Mr. Jones I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t screen ye longer,&rdquo; exclaimed the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Screen me!&rdquo; exclaimed the prisoner; &ldquo;why what a pother you make about a
      little trifling civility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trifling civility!&rdquo; exclaimed&rsquo; the astonished constable: &ldquo;Oh, murder,
      murder! there&rsquo;s nothing like ungratitude. Trifling civility! Och, Artur
      French&mdash;I have done wid ye. When you were cotched in the garret,
      drinkin taa with Mr. Abbot&rsquo;s maid, who got ye off, Artur? When the
      sawyer&rsquo;s arm was broke in the <i>roohawn</i> at Pie-corner, who got the
      tinker&rsquo;s wife to prove your alabay, and sware she met ye wid Kitty
      Flanigan, in Mud Island? When&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, stop man: what&rsquo;s the use of raking up old yarns? Peter, I always
      said you were a decent cove&mdash;but they swear you&rsquo;re doting lately, and
      that you&rsquo;ll never stop till ye turn Methodist. Only for the tender regard
      I have for yourself, I would give up your shop altogether, and take my
      custom across the water to Mary&rsquo;s watchhouse. But I can&rsquo;t forget old
      friendship&mdash;the more so, when I remember that your mother and mine
      were both born in Roscommon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A horse-laugh was heard from the fire-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, have done wid your blarney,&rdquo; said the commander, testily, &ldquo;and
      nivir mind my mother. What charge is again ye, the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;a mere trifle; I was endeavouring to make peace.&rdquo; returned
      Mr. French, with unblushing effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty like a whale!&rdquo; observed the commander, in a side whisper. &ldquo;I
      charge him wid a felonious assault!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice from behind the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step forward, young man.&rdquo; And the complainant placed himself in front of
      Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;r charge?&rdquo; inquired the judge. &ldquo;What have ye to say agin this
      respectable young gentleman, who was strivin&rsquo; to bring about pace and
      harmony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pace and harmony!&rdquo; exclaimed the complainant; &ldquo;he was the worst of the
      whole lot, barrin&rsquo; the quaker. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been a blow, but for
      the two of them; and the quaker&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The quaker&rsquo;s not before this court,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradley, with great
      dignity: and yet Mr. Bradley told a fib; for the identical Quaker was
      lying sound asleep upon the guard bed. &ldquo;What charge do you make, young
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that Mr. French, as you call him, split my ear with a black thorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you villain!&rdquo; exclaimed the accused. &ldquo;Now, Peter, the fellow&rsquo;s on his
      oath. Peter, I leave it to you. On the nick of your sowl, as an honest
      man, don&rsquo;t I always fight with a sapling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, in troth!&rdquo; responded three charlies in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Peter, what do you say to that? Wouldn&rsquo;t that make a man&rsquo;s hair
      stand an end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my conscience,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bradley, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thunderstruck&mdash;young
      man, what&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;r name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sniggs,&rdquo; said the complainant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tailor, to trade,&rdquo; replied the accuser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Sniggs,&rdquo; returned Mr. Bradley, &ldquo;the least I can do is to transport
      ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transport me!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished tailor: &ldquo;Arrah, for what? Is it
      for having my ear split?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue; I see, though young, ye&rsquo;r a hardened offender. Have ye
      no conscience,1 man? Oh, murder! to try and sware away the life of an
      innicint gintleman!&mdash;Is your mother livin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sniggs, not exactly comprehending the drift of Mr.
      Bradley&rsquo;s examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sister, or brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nather,&rdquo; returned the quondam accuser; but now, as it would appear, by
      some freak of fortune transmuted into the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have ye no relashins, good nor bad, ye unfortunit divil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied the artist, &ldquo;a third cousin, a well-behaved girl she is,
      and greatly respected by her mistress, who&rsquo;s married to a tanner in the
      Liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Peter graciously, &ldquo;on account of that well-behaved girl, your
      third cousin, I&rsquo;ll show mercy to you this time. Turn him out. Go home and
      repent, Sniggs: God forgive ye! that&rsquo;s all I have to say. Be off wid ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, blur and nouns!&rdquo; ejaculated the disappointed tailor, &ldquo;and is that
      all the satisfaction I&rsquo;m to get for having my ear slit like a swallow&rsquo;s
      tail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with him, I say. Wait till I ketch ye here agen, Sniggs. Be this
      book,&rdquo; (and Peter flourished the empty pewter-pot) &ldquo;that well-behaved
      girl, your third cousin that lives wid the tanner, won&rsquo;t get you off the
      second time. I wish the drink was come. I&rsquo;m grately fatigued givin&rsquo; good
      advice&mdash;it always laves me dry as a whistle. But what&rsquo;s to be done
      wid the chap in the corner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use spakin&rsquo; to him now,&rdquo; returned a watchman; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s blind
      drunk, and fast asleep into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he do much damage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; returned Mr. French; &ldquo;poor divil! he couldn&rsquo;t stand, let alone
      strike. At the commencement of the row he was knocked down like a
      nine-pin, and I wonder he was not trodden to death. Send him home, Peter
      &lsquo;pon my life, it&rsquo;s dangerous to keep him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye joking, Artur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, honour bright, Peter. Look at his buttons, one of ye. What&rsquo;s the
      number of his regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The twenty-first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away with him to George&rsquo;s-street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, and upon my conscience, ourselves ought to know the road purty
      well. God&rsquo;s blessin&rsquo; attind the Kilkinnys! it was a plasure to do bisnis
      wid them;&mdash;four or five to be carried home, reglar, at two shillins a
      head, and no cobblin&rsquo; about the money afterwards. The sergeant of the
      guard tallied them as they eame in, and it was only to bring the score to
      the quarter-master, and down came the brads in the mornin&rsquo;. But who&rsquo;s to
      pay for this chap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the wild collegian, as he tossed a piece of money to the
      speaker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only what one gentleman should do for another, when he&rsquo;s
      too drunk to be able to do it for himself. But here comes supper. I wonder
      what became of the quaker. Ah, Peter! he <i>was</i> a trump&mdash;and such
      a hitter! I&rsquo;ll respect a quaker while I live. Give me a pull of &lsquo;the
      heavy,&rsquo; and let us have the cockles while they are hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Bradley, with his young and amiable friend, proceeded to discuss
      their supper, a couple of watchmen lifted the unfortunate quaker off the
      guard-bed. The movement roused him; but it was soon evident that the late
      symposium was still uppermost in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said the charlie; &ldquo;step out like a man; we&rsquo;re bringin&rsquo; you
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark elicited a drunken effort to be melodious&mdash;and Mr Pryme
      sang, or strove to sing, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go home till morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The divil a here ye&rsquo;ll stay then,&rdquo; responded his supporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine&mdash;more wine.&mdash;&lsquo;Wine cures the gout,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned the quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does, sorra touch you&rsquo;ll have of the disorder for a month of
      Sundays. Come along wid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quaker&rsquo;s head was still ringing with drunken madrigals, and he
      proceeded to chaunt &ldquo;Old King Cole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, don&rsquo;t bother us wid King Cole; but try and put the feet aninder
      ye. We&rsquo;ll bring ye to George&rsquo;s-street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; no muttered the Quaker; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go home to the Merchants&rsquo; Quay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a sich an umproper place ye&rsquo;ll go near. Haven&rsquo;t ye been enough on
      the <i>ran-tan</i> already the night?&rdquo; and away they toddled towards the
      barracks, which destination was safely reached, and the body of the pseudo
      lieutenant delivered to the guard, with an intimation on the part of the
      watchmen, that on the morrow particular inquiries should be made touching
      the general health of the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be the officer that joined last week,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Go
      to his room and find his servant; and first put a knapsack under his head,
      and take his stock off. To do him justice, I never saw a more drunken
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When John Crawford was awakened, and had made a personal inspection, to
      the utter surprise of the main guard, &ldquo;pioneers and all,&rdquo; he repudiated
      the sleeping gentleman, and satisfactorily illustrated the old adage, that
      the cowl no more constitutes a monk, than a red jacket makes the soldier.
      Honest John&rsquo;s first care was to secure his master&rsquo;s uniform from further
      damage, which he contrived to effect by the substitution of a shooting
      jacket; and then, <i>nemine contradicente</i>, it was agreed, that drunken
      men should be permitted to sleep themselves sober; and that accordingly,
      the unhappy puritan should be left in undisturbed repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning dawned through the guard-room lattice before Samuel Pryme awoke.
      If there be a feeling more horrible than another, it is the return of
      reason to a drunken neophyte when he wakens after his first debauch. The
      quaker stared wildly round him; there were twenty men in the room&mdash;all
      strangers to him; some sleeping on the wooden bench on which he lay, and
      others sitting smoking by the fire. His head was giddy&mdash;his brain
      wandered&mdash;he was tortured with a burning thirst. Where was he?
      Suddenly his pale cheeks reddened with shame; he felt like a Hindu who has
      lost caste; and, burying his face between his hands, in a smothered voice
      that bespoke a consciousness of abasement, while tears fell fast, he
      faintly murmured, &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant laid aside a book which he had been reading in the window&mdash;and,
      though a rough soldier, he felt sincerely for the penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on so,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Young folk will be giddy. Bless your heart&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      none of our gentlemen that arn&rsquo;t wildish now and then. I wish we could get
      you something to drink; but the canteen is closed. Would you like to go
      home? I dare not spare a man; but I&rsquo;ll send for Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran&rsquo;s servant,
      and pass him through the gate.&rdquo; The quaker thanked him, but declined
      assistance; asked for and received a draught of water &ldquo;cold from the
      pump,&rdquo; the sentry unclosed the wicket, and Samuel Pryme returned to his
      father&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;a sadder, if not a wiser man,&rdquo; than when he quitted it
      the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck five. Peter Bradley was snoring on his guard-bed, and Mr.
      French taking his ease at an unpretending hostelrie in Smock Alley, not
      generally known in the fashionable world, but, patronized by the pleasant
      part of the community, and ycleped &ldquo;The Hole in the Wall.&rdquo; I felt as much
      at home in my dormitory as if I had been legal proprietor of it, while he,
      unhappy youth! reconnoitred the house from the outside, with all the
      suspicion of a man who meditates a burglary on the premises. In their
      respective chambers, Mrs. Pryme and her handmaiden had owned the influence
      of the drowsy god, and Rachel slumbered with as safe a conscience as if
      she had never kissed a fusileer. There is an old saw, gentle reader, which
      insinuates that it is prudent occasionally to allow &ldquo;sleeping dogs to
      lie.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll adopt it &ldquo;for the nonce&rdquo;&mdash;inquire what had befallen that
      <i>alter ego</i>, my foster-brother, and, with your gracious permission,
      follow through the next chapter, the fortunes of Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>lthough I departed
      from Kilcullen at cockcrow, Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole, having borrowed some
      hours from the night, had taken the road before me. Apprehensive of the
      desperate lengths to which deserted dairy-maids may be driven, the
      fosterer moved off without beat of drum; and the better to evade pursuit,
      had Kitty Dwyer attempted to recover the truant, and &ldquo;vi et armis&rdquo; repair
      her reputation by a sanatory visit to the altar, Mr. O&rsquo;Toole prudently
      declined marching by the mail-coach road, and masked his retreat with an
      ability that puzzled the priest himself. But as it turned out, Mark
      Antony&rsquo;s caution was unnecessary. Kitty bore her bereavement like a
      Christian woman,&mdash;hinted that the sea held as good fish as ever had
      been taken yet,&mdash;and, from divers hymeneal overtures, blessed God
      that she had no grounds for despondency. Aiding and assisting sound
      philosophy with &ldquo;rum and true religion,&rdquo; she got over her disappointment&mdash;within
      a fortnight, the false one was forgotten&mdash;Miss Dwyer &ldquo;open to an
      offer&rdquo;&mdash;and ready to commit matrimony at sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days before his evasion from my father&rsquo;s house, Mark Antony had
      privately despatched his kit by a Dublin carrier, and the few necessaries
      required for his journey were formed into a bundle of small dimensions,
      and suspended from the extremity of a well-tried shillelagh. Dressed in a
      smart morning suit that erstwhile had called me owner, the fosterer had
      more than once examined his outer man with evident satisfaction. His step
      was light, his breast without a care, and his pocket heavier than it had
      ever been before&mdash;he went on his way rejoicing&mdash;and when evening
      began to close, Mark Antony had placed five-and-twenty miles between him
      and that ill-requited fair one, whose only crime was loving &ldquo;not wisely
      but too well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half a century ago Irish engineers, in Yankee parlance, were &ldquo;reg&rsquo;lar
      go-a-heads.&rdquo; Neither condescending to turn to the right or to the left,
      they crossed the country &ldquo;as God had made it,&rdquo; took the bull by the horns,
      and scorning to steal round a hill they boldly breasted it. The fosterer
      had been escalading one of these heights for the last hour, and, on
      topping its ridge, overtook two wayfarers of opposite sexes who had
      preceded him in the ascent, and were now resting after its achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like himself, the travellers were not incommoded with heavy baggage, for
      what appeared to be their united kit was even smaller than his own, and
      was comprehended within the compass of a faded silk-handkerchief. The man
      was stout, undersized, and looked full thirty&mdash;the girl seemed
      scarcely nineteen&mdash;and from their dress and general appearance, the
      fosterer was sorely at a loss to decide to what grade of society the
      strangers appertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male traveller&rsquo;s dingy black frock had once seen better days, and his
      buff vest and nankeen unmentionables would have been all the better for a
      visit to the laundress. His hat was of that order denominated &ldquo;shocking
      bad,&rdquo; while it seemed doubtful that his boots would bear him to the end of
      his journey, and if they did, it would be by an expiring effort with which
      their history must close. His complexion was sallow, his features large,
      his whiskers black and bushy, he looked a dirty Jew; and certainly, &ldquo;take
      him for all in all,&rdquo; he was not the sort of person whom a gentleman would
      borrow money to entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every particular the girl was unlike her companion. She was pretty,
      tall, fair, and well formed. Her costume&mdash;a collection of faded
      finery&mdash;was tolerably clean; and, poverty apart, her air and address
      were those of one who had once moved in a different sphere, and, to judge
      by appearances, of one also, upon whom fortune had frowned severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      On both sides some civilities were interchanged; and to an inquiry from
      the fosterer as to where entertainment and lodgings could be found, the
      man pointed out a solitary house at the distance of a mile, intimating
      that it was a carman&rsquo;s stage held by travellers in high estimation. It was
      moreover kept by a buxom widow, and denominated.

      The ice once broken, the dark gentleman became very communicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want good fare, prime whisky, and a sound snooze, the Cock&rsquo;s your
      place, sir. The landlady&rsquo;s a trump, parlour snug, and not a flea if you
      searched the beds for a fortnight. Come, my love,&rdquo; and he addressed his
      fair companion, who frowned an angry answer to this term of endearment,&mdash;&ldquo;you
      and I are for the same crib, and we&rsquo;ll give this gentleman our company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stroller spoke with the volubility of an auctioneer, and thus
      continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady, sir, is my sister,&mdash;Miss Julia Montague. We are both
      professional,&mdash;known extensively in the dramatic world,&mdash;I, in
      the comic line&mdash;and Julia, in the musical. Bad spec at Granard&mdash;manager

      bolted with any blunt there was&mdash;left the company without a <i>tanner</i>,
      and obliged July and myself to travel here <i>tandem</i>,&mdash;one leg
      before the other. Better luck again,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll both be on the boards of
      Crow-street before Christmas&mdash;eh, July?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Jew had named the connexion between himself and the wandering
      melodist, Mark Antony&rsquo;s incredulous stare was returned by a look of
      contempt directed by the lady at her companion, which disclaimed
      relationship altogether; and a trifling incident ended the attempt at
      imposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knot of the handkerchief which secured the joint-stock property of the
      comedian and the <i>cantatrice</i> had slipped unperceived, and when the
      accident was discovered, portions of the wardrobe were seen upon the road
      a hundred yards in the rear. Mr. Montague started off to recover the
      missing valuables, and Julia and Mark Antony were thus for a brief space
      left together. The opportunity was not neglected. The girl, after a
      searching glance behind, suddenly addressed the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger, beware!&mdash;you know not the scoundrel who has been speaking
      to you. He&rsquo;s all a lie,&mdash;a Jew, a sleight-of-hand man, a pickpocket,
      and a pugilist. Avoid him, or he&rsquo;ll cheat you first, and bully you
      afterwards.&rdquo; (A smile from Mark Antony intimated that on the latter score
      he was incredulous altogether.) &ldquo;He followed me without my knowledge, and
      joined me on the road. Will you protect me to the next town? I would not
      trust myself another hour in that villain&rsquo;s company. But soft&mdash;he
      comes,&rdquo;&mdash;and, with ready tact, she changed the conversation to some
      common-place occurrence as the Jew hurried up and joined them. A few
      minutes more brought them to the Cock and Punch-bowl, which proved to be a
      low and straggling edifice situated at the junction of four roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mark Antony had rapidly adopted the prejudices of his fair monitress,
      he now regarded the Israelite with feelings of aversion and contempt. To
      fear he was a stranger&mdash;and the very knowledge that the Jew was a
      regular prize-fighter, probably occasioned on his part a more unequivocal
      display of personal antipathy. On entering the hostlerie, Mr. O&rsquo;Toole
      asked for and obtained a private apartment&mdash;ordered supper for the
      Prima Donna and himself&mdash;intimating plainly to the fat landlady, that
      notwithstanding his celebrity in the comic line, Mr. Montague was not to
      be a member of the mess&mdash;and that, accordingly, the Jew and himself
      must remain what they had hitherto been&mdash;strangers to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now twilight. The girl, but not without some difficulty, had
      recovered her bundle from the sleight-of-hand man, who, after several
      audacious attempts at a renewal of acquaintance, which on the part of the
      fosterer were as decidedly repulsed, was obliged to put up with a seat
      beside the kitchen fire, and there enjoy the tantalizing prospect of
      watching the progress of a supper at which his presence had been
      interdicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noise outside attracted the fair vocalist and her protector to the
      window. It was a recruiting party <i>en route</i> to a neighbouring
      pattern, to pick up &ldquo;food for powder.&rdquo; There, a festival was held, where
      fame spoke truly, love and penance, whisky and broken heads, were all so
      agreeably united, that the man who could not be happy at Cahirmore must be
      suited only for &ldquo;stratagems and treasons,&rdquo; and a personage upon whom
      pleasure would be thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charge of foot which halted at the Cock and Punchbowl consisted of a
      sergeant, whose waist the sash found difficulty to encompass&mdash;a brace
      of privates too dirty for the ranks, but who crimped inimitably&mdash;a
      boy, taller than his drum by the head&mdash;and a lean and sallow fifer
      who had counted forty summers; these with a couple of recruits completed
      this &ldquo;gallant gathering.&rdquo; On the shoulders of the stouter, the sergeant&rsquo;s
      pack was strapped; while to the honourable keeping of the other, the
      commander&rsquo;s bilboa was entrusted&mdash;a weapon, whose unstained steel had
      never yet been &ldquo;incarnadined&rdquo; with human gore. The soldiers presently
      ensconced themselves in a room beneath&mdash;Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary paraded the
      expected supper&mdash;Mark Antony and his fair friend sealed themselves
      and commenced active operations, the fosterer eating as men eat who have
      walked thirty miles of Irish measurement, and the vocalist, as if to her,
      poor girl! for many a day a comfortable meal had been unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the rejected Israelite bade fair to sup with Duke
      Humphry. Admission to the state apartment was hopeless, for from thence he
      had been peremptorily excluded. In the kitchen, divers hints had been
      dropped that his absence would be preferable to his company; and as Jews
      don&rsquo;t list, the soldiers repudiated him altogether. Deeply incensed
      against the wandering actress for deserting him in this &ldquo;his hour of
      need,&rdquo; and stung to the quick by the firmness and contempt with which Mark
      Antony repelled all advances towards intimacy, he secretly vowed vengeance
      against both. Luckily, a Hebrew&rsquo;s resources procured him an unexpected
      supply. Some countrymen, returning from market, stopped to refresh
      themselves by the way. The Jew amused them with his tricks, and in return
      <i>thimble-rigged</i> as many sixpences from the farmers, as enabled him
      to obtain a lodging in the Cock and Punchbowl for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was removed, and Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary had produced the necessary
      materials for finishing an evening comfortably, at the pressing invitation
      of her guest she sat down with the youthful travellers. From the first,
      Mark Antony had found favour in the widow&rsquo;s sight, and a more extended
      acquaintance confirmed the early impression. Towards the girl Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary
      evinced a kindly feeling, and proposed that as the house was crowded, the
      wayfarer should share her bed&mdash;an offer, by Miss Julia Montague,
      gratefully accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buxom widow was a fair specimen of an Irish hostess; and had her eyes
      not been as dark as a blackberry and her complexion a gipsy brown, the old
      alliteration, &ldquo;fat, fair, and forty,&rdquo; would have described her to a hair.
      Her comely countenance was rich with archness and <i>espieglerie</i>&mdash;and
      in Jack Falstaff&rsquo;s vein a lover might have safely wooed her&mdash;You are
      merry, so am I. Ha, ha&mdash;then there&rsquo;s more sympathy! &ldquo;In vino
      veritas.&rdquo; Hang that musty proverb! What&rsquo;s wine to whisky punch? That is,
      indeed, the opener of the human heart. Love may be eschewed&mdash;but who
      is proof against <i>poteeine</i>? A hot tumbler would undo the caution of
      a Jesuit, and make a Trappist speak out like a man. Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary felt the
      genial influence of <i>mountain dew</i> agreeably diluted; and in the
      brief colloquy that ensued, there were but few circumstances connected
      with the Cock and Punchbowl which remained a secret to the fosterer and
      his wandering friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Toole&mdash;there&rsquo;s an O before your name, I b&rsquo;lieve&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      kindly welcome. Here&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;r health&mdash;and bad luck to ye if I wish it.
      As I told ye, Mr. O&rsquo;Leary&mdash;Lord rest his sowl!&mdash;was an ailin&rsquo; 
      man, and might have been my father. Well, after the cold Christmas he went
      like snow off a ditch. The Lord sees he had the best of tratement in his
      last days, wid a grand wake and a ginteel funeral. I&rsquo;m a lone woman three
      years come Patrick mass&mdash;and och! I have had my trouble. A woman&rsquo;s
      helpless, Mr. O&rsquo;Toole, and that ye know. Well&mdash;blessed be God! I&rsquo;m
      well to do&mdash;owe nobody a rap&mdash;and my carakter&rsquo;s at the defiance
      of the parish. But och! I&rsquo;m lonely after all; and a pushin&rsquo; woman like me
      requires a man&rsquo;s assistance. Not that I&rsquo;m over anxious to get married; but
      if a young man, discreat and well-behaved, would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a furious knocking of pewter pots upon the tables underneath
      interrupted Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s narration, and she made a hasty exit to attend
      those turbulent customers, with an intimation however that she would
      return anon, and make a clean breast touching her hymeneal intentions,
      should &ldquo;a young man, discreat and well-behaved,&rdquo; present himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident from the hilarious revelry in the kitchen, that the
      company below had no sin of omission, as far as drinking went, to answer
      for. Indeed it was pretty apparent that they were set in for a regular
      carouse. The sergeant and his comrades prudently uniting mirth with
      business, had favoured the countrymen with their company, in the double
      hope of enjoying a potation, scot-free&mdash;and if luck were on their
      side, crimping a clod-hopper into the bargain. The antiquated fifer, on
      his &ldquo;ear-piercing&rdquo; instrument had executed &ldquo;the Groves of Blarney,&rdquo; with a
      variety of flourishes which elicited a thunder of applause. As to the
      commander, he was affability itself&mdash;spoke of his &ldquo;feats of broil,&rdquo;
       and recounted the numerous &ldquo;battles, sieges, fortunes,&rdquo; through which he
      had passed, with a vividness of description that made the very hair of the
      listeners stand on end. Nothing could be more glowing than the narrative,
      albeit, it was apocryphal entirely; for during his peaceful life, he,
      worthy man, had never witnessed a musket snapped in anger. At the request
      of a gentleman, whose solitary stripe announced him to he still on the
      lowest step of the ladder of preferment, the sergeant obliged the company
      with a rigmarole effusion which he was pleased to call a song; and it is
      only necessary to say, that the poetry and performance were worthy of each
      other.

    <p>
      Great was the applause which the sergeant&rsquo;s melody drew down, and, what
      was probably even more satisfactory to the honest gentleman, a loud demand
      arose for a fresh supply of &ldquo;the raw material and the carouse was
      vigorously resumed. Left to themselves, the young travellers had talked
      over their meeting on the mountain, and spoke of their journey to the
      neighbouring town next day where their road-companionship was to
      terminate. The intended parting was not mentioned with indifference, for
      the poor girl sighed heavily, her face became sad, and her eyes filled
      fast. In a faction fight, where skulls were cracked like walnuts, Mark
      Antony was every inch a hero&mdash;but his heart was true Milesian, and a
      woman&rsquo;s sorrow rendered it soft as a turnip. He took the wanderer&rsquo;s hand
      affectionately, kissed away the tear that trickled down her cheek, and
      endeavoured to dispel her melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have happier days before you, and youth enough
      to wait for them. How can I serve you, Julia.-&rsquo; I know an empty pocket
      makes a heavy heart&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll share to the last shilling&mdash;&rdquo; and
      quick as lightning a green silk purse that I had given to the fosterer the
      night we parted, was transferred from his pocket to the wanderer&rsquo;s hand.
      &ldquo;Come. Julia,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;will I bring you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl shook her head, and gratefully returned the purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take half, at least,&rdquo; exclaimed Mark Antony; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only five pounds in
      notes, and three guineas and a half in gold. May&rsquo;be it may carry ye to
      your friends&mdash;and if it won&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ll list, and that will make up
      the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; said the girl, bitterly; &ldquo;I have no friends: I lost my mother
      when an infant; and the cruel desertion of my father broke the old
      soldier&rsquo;s heart. Alas! I feel that I am left alone upon the earth, without
      one being who would care for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sister, by Heaven!&rdquo; cried the fosterer. &ldquo;Am I not also a soldier&rsquo;s
      orphan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ye thundering villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary, who had stolen
      softly up stairs, and caught the Jew with his ear at the key-hole, &ldquo;Off
      wid ye, ye blackavised disciple. Bad luck attend ye, night an&rsquo; day, you
      ugly thief! Off, I say&mdash;&rdquo; and, suiting the action to the word, she
      bestowed a heavy buffet upon the countenance of the Israelite that made
      him in no way desirous of abiding another visitation from the widow&rsquo;s
      fist. &ldquo;Well, dears!&rdquo; said the jolly hostess as she bustled into the room:
      &ldquo;may&rsquo;be ye were courtin&rsquo; a bit, as young people will at times&mdash;and
      think of that black-muzzled ruffin lis&rsquo;ning to every word ye sed! I wish
      he was clane out of the house, for he has the gallows in his faee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, indeed,&rdquo; observed the girl, &ldquo;that he was gone&mdash;I dread that
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah!&rdquo; returned the burly widow, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t vex ye&rsquo;rself about him: ye&rsquo;r
      safe wid me&mdash;the devil a toe he&rsquo;ll venture to put near my room. Ye&rsquo;r
      tired, <i>avourneein</i>; and come away to ye&rsquo;r-bed: and if you, Mr.
      O&rsquo;Toole, will jist step down and take an air of the fire below, I&rsquo;ll make
      ye a shake-down here as the house is crowded to the thatch.&rdquo; Mark Antony
      accordingly bade his companion a good night, and descended to the kitchen,
      where, by a sort of common consent, the whole of the guests had united
      themselves for a general jollification. The whisky now seemed &ldquo;uppermost,&rdquo;
       and most of the party w&rsquo;ere as it is termed in Ireland &ldquo;the worse of
      liquor;&rdquo; but the hilarity was as yet undisturbed,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And all went merry as a marriage bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy sergeant who, like Bardolph, was &ldquo;white-livered and red-faced,&rdquo;
       with Pistol&rsquo;s qualification of having &ldquo;a killing tongue and quiet sword,&rdquo;
       was evidently the lion of the evening; and being a romancer of the first
      magnitude, no man was better suited to fascinate a company who took
      delight in listening to deeds of arms. He was graciously pleased to reply
      to the inquiry of a recruit, who had expressed a strong curiosity touching
      the personal appearance of Napoleon le grand. Having bolted a dose of
      alcohol presented to him by a countryman, and deposited the pewter measure
      on the table, the commander thus modestly continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so ye would like to know what Boney&rsquo;s like? Well, the divil a man ye
      would meet in a day&rsquo;s walk could tell you that same thing better. He has a
      regular gunpowder complexion, a look that would frighten a horse, and
      whiskers you could hang your hat upon. Father Abraham&rsquo;s in the corner
      there&mdash;and &lsquo;pon my conscience, honest man, ye would be the better of
      a barber&mdash;are but a joke to them.&rdquo; And he pointed to the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you see him?&rdquo; inquired a countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I see him? Where&mdash;but in Agypt,&rdquo; returned the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I was pris&rsquo;ner five minutes, he sends an aidi-camp hot-foot&mdash;well,
      up I comes&mdash;for there was no use, you know, resistin&rsquo;. At first he
      looked red-pepper at me: &lsquo;Corp&rsquo;lar Mulrooney,&rsquo; says he&mdash;and how the
      dickens he med my name out, I nivir could lam&mdash;&lsquo;Mulrooney,&rsquo; says he,
      &lsquo;for once in ye&rsquo;r life, tell truth, and shame the divil.&mdash;How many
      thousand strong are ye?&rsquo; &lsquo;Twenty-five thousand,&rsquo; says I, strivin&rsquo; to
      dacave him. &lsquo;Bad luck to the liars!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo; says I, just givin&rsquo; 
      the word back to him. &lsquo;Arrah&mdash;come,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be makin&rsquo; a Judy
      Fitzsummon&rsquo;s mother of ye&rsquo;rself, but tell the truth, Mulrooney, and I&rsquo;ll
      make a man of ye: an&rsquo; if ye don&rsquo;t&rsquo;&mdash;sw&rsquo;aring an oath that I now
      disremimber, because it was in Frinch&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll blow the contents of
      this pistol thro&rsquo; your scull,&rsquo; pulling out one with a barrel like a
      blunderbuss. Well, I was rather scared; but, thinks I, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; 
      like being bould. &lsquo;Fire away,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;an&rsquo; put ye&rsquo;r information in ye&rsquo;r
      pocket afterwards; for it&rsquo;s all ye&rsquo;ll get from me.&rsquo; Bonypart looked
      bothered: &lsquo;Be gogstay,&rdquo; says he, to the aidicamp, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s cliver of the
      corp&rsquo;lar. Let him off,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;an&rsquo; if there&rsquo;s a drain of spirits in the
      bottle, give it to him, the crature, for the day&rsquo;s hot.&rsquo; Wid that, he
      pulls out a thirty-shillin&rsquo; note. &lsquo;Divil blister the rap I have more, or
      ye should have it,&rsquo; says he, shakes me dacently by the han&rsquo;, and sends me
      clane back. &lsquo;Pon me soul! Boney&rsquo;s not a bad man, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant&rsquo;s interview with Napoleon had been listened to with great
      attention; and at the production of the pistol of blunderbuss calibre, the
      recruits actually turned pale. The Israelite alone exhibited symptoms of
      incredulity, but what could be expected from an unbeliever? As to Mark
      Antony, he laughed outright;&mdash;however, that was an effect which some
      of the bloodiest exploits of the gallant sergeant frequently produced upon
      his auditory, and accordingly, he, &ldquo;good easy man,&rdquo; passed it by
      unnoticed. The symposium promised to terminate in harmony and peace, alas!
      how delusory that promise proved!

      external appearances, King George the Third, of blessed memory, never laid
      out money to less advantage, than when he induced private Ulic Flyn of the
      gallant twenty-seventh, ycleped the Enniskilleners, to undertake the
      defence of &ldquo;his crown and dignity&rdquo; for the modest consideration of twelve
      pounds bounty, and thirteenpence-halfpenny a day. Although the standard
      then was low, how the devil Mr. Flyn contrived to touch it, remained a
      mystery. Ulic was barely five feet one, his singular proportions had
      driven three sergeants to desperation, to &ldquo;set him up&rdquo; was declared to be
      an impossibility; he was moreover, too dirty for a pioneer, and to what
      military uses he might return, none could even guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only for a season that his candle remained under a bushel.
      Certes, honest Ulic, <i>in propriâ persona</i>, was no hero; to bloodshed
      generally he had an invincible antipathy; and had &ldquo;the imminent deadly
      breach&rdquo; remained unmounted until Mr. Flyn made the essay, it would have
      been safe for ever. To a higher order of things his talents appertained;
      his crimping was magnificent, and the wariest bog-trotter who ever
      dispensed with shoes, had reason to look sharp if he foregathered with
      Ulic Flyn over a noggin of whisky, and was not made &ldquo;food for powder&rdquo;
       afterwards. While the sergeant was narrating his interview with Napoleon,
      Ulic continued in deep conference with the most intoxicated of the
      countrymen, and had the unhappy bumpkin known the truth, in the course of
      his life he had never been in such dangerous company before. On one flank,
      Mr. Flyn waited an opportunity to enlist him, and on the other, Mr.
      Montague, of comic celebrity, was experimentalizing on his side-pocket.
      Both were clever in their line, but, as the result proved, of the twain
      the Jew was the <i>abler artiste</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than one hint had been already given that the pleasantest company
      must part; and, as a speedy movement was at hand, Mr. Flyn redoubled his
      exertions to add to the defenders of the realm, and do the state some
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a life we lead!&rdquo; he whispered in the countryman&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to do from one end of the year to the other, but eat, drink,
      sleep, and clean a musket!&mdash;lots of liberty!&mdash;go where you like,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get crammed into the black-hole on your return, and be kept at pack-drill
      with a log upon your leg for a fortnight,&rdquo; responded the Israelite with a
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flyn directed a murderous side-look at the unbeliever, who appeared
      determined to render useless all his honourable efforts to uphold the
      glory of the land; but still the short gentleman continued to draw a
      pleasing and veracious picture of military life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our colonel&rsquo;s such a trump&mdash;a gentleman every inch. He dances with
      the sergeants&rsquo; wives, calls every man by his right name&mdash;Tom, Bill,
      or Jerry,&mdash;and his purse is always in his fingers. &lsquo;Ulic,&rsquo; says he to
      me, as I passed him in the barrack yard last Friday, &lsquo;go, drink my health,
      ye divil, and if you get glorious, why tell the adjutant that I bid ye do
      so,&rsquo; and with that he tosses me half-a-crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! what a wopper!&rdquo; ejaculated the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s the very terror of the regiment,&mdash;orders a man &lsquo;a hundred&rsquo; 
      for sneezing on parade, and flogs regularly twice a week to give the
      drummers exercise. Take my advice, young man; be off at once, or that&rsquo;ere
      chap will do ye brown.&rdquo; So saying, he closed his left eye, rose, and
      returned to the fire, under the pretence of lighting his pipe; for having
      succeeded in drawing out the countryman&rsquo;s money-bag while he gave him good
      advice, the Jew was anxious to move from the immediate vicinity of the
      prigged pocket, before the abstraction of its contents should be
      discovered. The fifer immediately took the vacant seat, Mr. Flyn became
      more eloquent than ever, but the unbeliever had done the mischief
      effectually&mdash;the bird was scared; and after announcing that he was &ldquo;a
      widow&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; the bumpkin stoutly declared that &ldquo;he would be shot at for
      nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The case seemed hopeless; but Mr. Flyn was not the person to despair. With
      affectionate ardour he seized the peasant&rsquo;s hand, swore that from first
      sight he had loved him like a brother, and consequently that they must
      have a parting glass. He discovered, unfortunately, that he had no silver;
      but the sergeant had enough for all, and he would trouble him to ask him,
      the sergeant, for a shilling. The request was made and granted; the polite
      commander instantly produced the current coin, Ulic Flyn called for
      another pint, the fifer, underneath the table, slily attached his own
      cockade to the dexter side of the <i>caubeeine</i> of the &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s son,&rdquo;
       while the lance corporal tapped him playfully on the shoulder, and hailed
      him for life a camarado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark suspicions flashed across the peasant&rsquo;s mind. What meaned this
      wondrous civility? His eye caught that of the Jew&mdash;he remembered the
      admonition of the Israelite&mdash;and was he &ldquo;done brown&rdquo; already? Up he
      sprang, desired his companions to come away, and would have bade the
      company &ldquo;a fair good-night,&rdquo; had not a gentle detainer been laid on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, my boy,&rdquo; exclaimed the commander. &ldquo;Drink like a soldier
      to-night&mdash;and in the morning ye&rsquo;ll have time enough to take lave of
      y&rsquo;er relashins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take lave of my relashins!&rdquo; returned the countryman, as he made a
      desperate effort to reach the door&mdash;an intention on his part which
      was promptly prevented; for on one side he was pinioned by the fifer, on
      the other collared by Mr. Flyn, while the commander talked something about
      the articles of war, and hinted that mutiny was punishable with death.

      The countrymen seized the intended hero by one arm, the crimps held on as
      doggedly by the other; and as both parties pulled stoutly, it might have
      been supposed that they intended to partition the victim between them.
      Pushes were succeeded by blows,&mdash;the <i>mêlée</i> became general.&mdash;Mark
      Antony joined the soldiers, the Jew sided with the countrymen, four or
      five couples were actively engaged in the centre of the floor&mdash;and
      divers on both sides, who, either from want of room or inclination had
      abstained from a personal display, carried on a sort of guerilla warfare,
      and, acting <i>en tirailleur</i>, kept up a lively discharge of turfs and
      pewter measures, apparently with perfect indifference as to whether the
      sculls their missiles might invade should prove Tyrian or Trojan. While
      delivering a murderous blow at his opponent, a recruit, with a sweep of
      his cudgel, brought down a shelf on which sundry specimens of the fine
      arts had been deposited; and, in the very act of deprecating hostilities,
      the commander received an erratic visit from a three-legged stool, which
      destroyed his perpendicular and sent him flying through a cupboard. The
      boy, small as he was, did not escape&mdash;he was driven through his own
      drum-head; and that stirring instrument of war was silenced most
      effectually.

      Irish rows end as quickly as they commence, and the <i>rookarn&rsquo;n</i> in
      the Cock and Punch-bowl at last began to languish. Sundry who had already
      figured in the fray, now cried &ldquo;hold! enough!&rdquo;&mdash;and others who had
      saluted their mother earth still remained there recumbent, opining that
      under existing circumstances, this position was the safer. Two combatants
      however, still remained unsatisfied. They had sought each other in the
      conflict; and now, by a sort of general consent, the floor was abandoned
      by all the other belligerents, and like bulls in a china shop, the
      fosterer and the Israelite were left with the arena to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were influenced by a deep feeling of personal hostility. The Jew
      hated (as Jews only know how to hate) because he had been rivalled and
      rejected. The fosterer, more than half in love, abhorred the Israelite for
      imagining aught that was injurious against the <i>cantatrice</i> who had
      elected him her knight; and further, from a pre-knowledge of Mr.
      Montague&rsquo;s pugilistic accomplishments, Mark Antony was dying for an
      opportunity to ascertain whether his own talents in that line had not been
      rather overrated, forgetting that in his own country no man is accounted
      above his value&mdash;be they pugilists or prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the men were matched unequally; and consequently the conflict was soon
      ended. In years the Jew was stale, and in heart a very coward&mdash;while
      with length and activity, the fosterer was fresh as a four-year-old and
      bold as a tiger. The &ldquo;master of fence&rdquo; proved not worth &ldquo;a dish of stewed
      prunes&rdquo;&mdash;he turned out nothing but a cur, and the desperate onslaught
      of the fosterer at once demolished his defensive system. The <i>finale</i>
      was sudden: in a few seconds the unbeliever lay stretched upon the floor
      of the Cock and Punch-bowl, and, to all appearance, defunct as Julius
      Cæsar. Heaven help him! The chances against the circumcised sinner were
      desperate all through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary was making a radical change in her toilet when she heard the
      alarm, and before she was ready for battle, the battle was over. Down she
      sallied like a Bacchante. Alas! it was only to see a defeated Israelite on
      the floor, and witness a demolition of property, the value of which was,
      like pearls, above price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavenly Antony!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and clapped her hands wildly
      together, &ldquo;if ivir I underwint such ruination since I was a girl. A man
      kilt in the house, and the image of my brother Dick that came from
      Philadelphy, all in smithereens!&rdquo; and she picked up fragments of plaster
      of Paris which once had formed &ldquo;a busto framed with every grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Queen of Sheba on the-broad of her back upon the floor, and
      the divil a morsel of the Prodigal Son left, good nor bad.&rdquo; She cast her
      eyes doubtfully around her, &ldquo;Holy Bridget!&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;why the door
      of the clock-case is in two halves! Murder! murder!&mdash;was ivir a lone
      woman brought to sich desalashin, and all done while ye could say Jack
      Robison! Arrah! what set ye a fightin&rsquo;, wid plenty of liquor, and ye
      singin&rsquo; like blackbirds when I left ye. May the widda&rsquo;s curse fall on
      them, night and day, that caused the skrimmage!&rdquo; Then turning to the
      fosterer, she inquired if he had been wounded in the affray, and with a
      marked anxiety Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary investigated the outer man of Mark Antony.
      Perceiving, however, that he was personally undamaged, she continued her
      inquiries as to the origin of what she called the <i>ruchshin</i>,
      intending no doubt to ameree the offender heavily for the losses she had
      sustained. Manifold were the causes alleged; but all, and by common
      consent, laid the blame on Mr. Montague. He was a Jew, therefore no
      allegation against him could be too bad. He was dead, and consequently he
      could deny nothing. Accordingly, the downfal of the Queen of Sheba, the
      demolition of my brother Dick, and the destruction of the Prodigal Son,
      all and every were placed to the account of the defunct, and carried in
      the affirmative, <i>neniine contradicente</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Montague was not dead. Like greater men, finding that the current
      of popular opinion had turned against him, he decided that nothing
      professional could be effected by a longer sojourn at the Cock and
      Punch-bowl, and that the sooner he abdicated the better. Accordingly while
      a noisy reconciliation was being effected, Mr. Montague &ldquo;cut his lucky,&rdquo;
       the belligerents returned to the table,&mdash;in a deep &ldquo;doch a durris&rdquo;
       all animosity was extinguished, and the whole separated as a Christian
      company should part, having in due course, and after the fashion of that
      pleasant country, drank, fought, committed murder, and sworn an eternal
      friendship afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and the hostlerie of Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary at cock-crow was in a
      bustle. The fosterer and his fair companion preparing for the road, and
      the sergeant, with his charge of foot, girding up their loins to proceed
      to Cahirmore. All however seemed in melancholy mood; some laying it upon
      love, while others left it upon liquor. Mark Antony was regularly
      bothered; and the actress, poor girl, sadly cast down at the immediate
      prospect of parting from one, who had proved himself a kind and generous
      protector. Nor had the jolly hostess escaped a visitation of the heart.
      What, though for three years she had eschewed all overtures to revisit the
      temple of Hymen, and rejected more suitors than Penelope, still the widow
      was flesh and blood like other people; and satisfied that in the person of
      Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole the cardinal virtues were united, she was ready for
      matrimony on demand, and prepared on the first summons to surrender the
      Cock and Punch-bowl&mdash;of course on honourable terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these visitations were of the sentimental order; but those sustained
      by the men of war were unhappily corporeal. It is true that the sergeant
      had a thick skull, but what chances have skulls with cupboards? and in the
      recent collision the skull of the commander was damaged grievously; the
      fifer&rsquo;s mouth was totally destroyed by a flush hit; each of the recruits
      had been favoured with a black eye; and, even to the diminutive drummer,
      none passed the ordeal unscathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody,&mdash;I think Shenstone,&mdash;after insinuating that he had
      travelled &ldquo;earth&rsquo;s dull round,&rdquo; declares that &ldquo;the warmest welcome&rsquo;s in an
      inn.&rdquo; Well, that may be the case; but the wayfarer cunningly passes over
      that brief but painful moment when the bell is gently touched, and a bill
      reluctantly requested with all the indifference a man in such
      circumstances can assume. That unlucky period had arrived. The sergeant
      inquired &ldquo;what was to pay?&rdquo; and the hostess responded, by producing a huge
      slate, and pointing to a long array of figures scored to the debit of the
      commander. At the sight of this, the countenance of the worthy man
      underwent a striking elongation; and he who beneath the withering glance
      of the conqueror of Lodi had not blanched, became pale as a ghost while he
      gazed on the hieroglyphics of the lady of the Cock and Punch-bowl. The
      commander shook his head, and the shake was significant; while the fifer
      stoutly affirmed that the whole of the nocturnal symposium had been
      charged against the protectors of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, what balderdash!&rdquo; exclaimed the hostess; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ye see four and
      eightpence agin the Carneys, wid a cross upon it, because it&rsquo;s ped? Mr.
      O&rsquo;Toole goes free; and there&rsquo;s fairly against ye all, two and fourpence
      for ating, and eleven and ninepence for the drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the charge of foot, even from the drum-boy to the commander, persisted
      in protestations of incredulity; and Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary, irritated that the
      accuracy of her reckoning should be doubted, gave indications of a
      &ldquo;flare-up&rdquo; which might have brought about another general engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck attend yes for a set of thieves! Wasn&rsquo;t it enough for ye to
      tatter my consarn, without bilkin me of my bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Ireland, questions are answered by interrogatories; and if you ask the
      way to a place, the reply will probably be an inquiry as to whether you
      &ldquo;met a donkey on the road, or noticed a blind woman with twins upon her
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who tattered y&rsquo;er consarn?&rdquo; responded the sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knocked the fire out of my eye wid a clod of turf as hard as a paving
      stone?&rdquo; inquired a recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who druv me thro&rsquo; the drum-head?&rdquo; screamed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who split my lip?&rdquo; demanded the fifer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be bothering me about y&rsquo;er drums and y&rsquo;er misfortins!&rdquo; replied the
      hostess, cold to the losses thus sustained in person and property by her
      unhappy visitors; &ldquo;but for once in y&rsquo;er lives, be honest, and down wid the
      reckoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant saw that it was idle to remonstrate, and he produced a
      one-pound note, called for a pint of whisky, received it and the change,
      bolted his &ldquo;morning&rdquo;&mdash;an example duly followed by all, even to the
      drummer; and, accompanied by his gallant following, wended his way in
      sadness and silence towards the Pattern of Cahirmore. For once, military
      pomp and pride were dispensed with,&mdash;the fife was mute, the drum beat
      no point of war, and the commander and his charge of foot stole off as
      modestly from the hostelrie, as if instead of being engaged over-night in
      pointing out the path of glory to the Carneys, they had picked pockets
      like the Jew, or robbed the widow&rsquo;s hen-roost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting between the men of war and the lady of the Cock and Punch-bowl
      was not accompanied with any ebullition of &ldquo;sweet sorrow&rdquo; upon either
      side, the commander hinting that it was his intention to transfer his
      patronage to the Cat and Bagpipes for the future; and the hostess
      declaring, that &ldquo;the loss was small, and were he better they were welcome
      to him.&rdquo; But a tenderer trial was at hand; and when Mark Antony and the
      fair cantatrice announced that they were about to take the road, the
      widow&rsquo;s grief burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, stay!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rest yourselves for a day or two longer. Well,
      ye won&rsquo;t. Put up y&rsquo;er purse, <i>astore</i>. Is it for me to charge craters
      of y&rsquo;er sort for a trifle of entertainment? Sorrow rap I&rsquo;d take if ye
      stay&rsquo;d here a twelvemonth. The world&rsquo;s wide; and many a straggler finds it
      hard to get across it. Well, jewel! if you stick fast, as many a man has
      done before ye, turn back to the widow&rsquo;s home, and here&rsquo;s y&rsquo;er <i>ceade
      fealteagh</i> * waiting for ye. When ye want it, ye&rsquo;ll find something in
      the basket,&rdquo; and she placed a small one in the fosterer&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And now,
      as y&rsquo;er for goin, may the Lord protect ye both!&rdquo; Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary wiped a tear
      away with the corner of her apron, kissed the pale girl affectionately,
      while the smack she gave Mark Antony might have been heard distinctly
      across the road. Next moment the wayfarers were over the hospitable
      threshold, and &ldquo;the world was all before them where to choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglicè&mdash;a warm welcome.
</pre>
    <p>
      The sky was clear, the country had become picturesque, the birds sang
      merrily, the road was sprinkled by an early shower, and on a pleasanter
      morning a light-bosomed traveller never wended on his way. Alas!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;The merry heart goes all the day.

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and before half the journey was completed, the girl showed symptoms of
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weary, Julia,&rdquo; said the fosterer; &ldquo;sit down, <i>avourneein</i>.
      In yonder corner there is a shady bank, and a stream too; ay, and with
      water blue and sparkling as your own soft eyes. Come, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pale girl looked steadily and suspiciously at her companion; but one
      glance dispelled her fears. The face she scrutinized was honest; and
      without hesitation, she quitted the high road, and seated herself on a
      fallen tree in the sheltered glade to which Mark Antony had pointed. Well,&mdash;she
      might do so safely. In grain, the fosterer was a gentleman; and, for a
      queen&rsquo;s ransom, he would not have abused confidence placed in his honour,
      or have imagined aught that was evil against a woman whose helplessness
      called upon him for protection. He flung himself at her feet upon the
      sward, and opening the widow&rsquo;s basket, produced a chicken, some oaten
      cakes, and a <i>cruiskeeine</i> of native whisky. The fowl was speedily
      dismembered; the contents of the flask diluted with the clear cold water
      of the rivulet; and, with kindly warmth, her companion urged the wanderer
      to refresh herself. But, poor girl! her heart was full. She gently put
      aside the food presented to her; tears fell fast, and hiding her face
      between her hands, she seemed to give way to some secret sorrow, too deep,
      too poignant for concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fosterer, but in vain, endeavoured to cheer her sinking spirits. The
      <i>cruislteeine</i> was laid down untasted; and while with youth&rsquo;s ardent
      eloquence, Mark Antony pointed to happiness in the distance, the deep sobs
      of his companion told that from her bosom that hope which cheers the
      darkest hour of life, was long departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Julia,&rdquo; he said, pressing her hand in his, &ldquo;why will you be
      so down-hearted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl raised her eyes. She did not reply; but her look betrayed
      the agony of the heart, and its sad and silent expression had &ldquo;the
      calmness of settled despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you been very&mdash;very unfortunate, Julia?&rdquo; pursued the
      fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer mournfully shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And left home, and friends, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, wildly, with a maniac&rsquo;s suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you decoyed away by a villain?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who wrecked my peace is in the grave. May Heaven pardon him as
      sincerely as I wish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably under the promise of marriage?&rdquo; said the fosterer, with the
      hesitation that a man feels who asks a question which possibly may cause
      pain or give offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The promise!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, while her pale cheeks flushed,
      and her eye lightened as if repelling a derogatory insinuation. No, no; it
      was indeed a sad reality, although the act was villanous and putting her
      hand into her bosom, she drew forth a wedding-ring, secured by a black
      ribbon. &ldquo;There is the token that I was a lawful wife; and there, also, a
      memorial that I was a&mdash;&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthless daughter. <i>Worthless!</i> worse far;&mdash;a parricide!
      Yes, yes; I murdered him. My misconduct broke his heart. My ingratitude
      quenched his broken spirit. I did not drug him to death; but I poisoned
      his happiness, and sent him to the grave. Am I not, then, a murderess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself wildly upon the fallen tree, and sobbed convulsively.
      &ldquo;Be calm;&rdquo; said Mark Antony, pressing her hand; &ldquo;I have given you pain;
      but Heaven knows I would not, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, &ldquo;you meant no harm; but where guilt abides,
      the conscience takes alarm. For a sad, sad, twelvemonth your&rsquo;s is the only
      heart that has warmed to me; your&rsquo;s the only ear to which I would confide
      my story. Hear me; and then say whether the crime or the retribution has
      been the greater. I am calm; but it seems to me a melancholy pleasure to
      disclose to a being who will sympathize, how much I have sinned, and how
      much I have suffered.&rdquo;&rsquo; She rose,&mdash;walked a few paces to a rock from
      which the mountain streamlet dropped into a basin which itself had formed;
      and having bathed her aching temples in the water, returned, and, to a
      most attentive listener, she thus detailed her history.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was born in a
      village on the coast of Sussex. My father, after five-and-twenty years&rsquo; 
      service, had retired from the army on a pension, with a small sum of money
      he had saved while acting in the West Indies as a quarter-master; and
      settling in his native village, he married the orphan daughter of a
      clergyman. The union was happy; and the evening of an adventurous life
      promised to wear quietly way. But, like all mortal expectations, my
      father&rsquo;s dream of happiness proved unreal, for my mother died in giving
      birth to me, leaving another child behind her, a boy, two years older than
      myself. My parents were warmly attached to each other, and the old soldier
      felt his bereavement acutely; but he bore up against his visitation like a
      man, and endeavoured by a devoted attachment to the living, to show how
      fondly he regarded the memory of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was little wonder that in my brother and myself, the widower
      should centre his affections. No relative of my mother was alive; and the
      only kinsman of my father was a half-brother, a dozen years older than
      himself; a man in every way unamiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josiah Rawlings was the village lawyer; a being without a heart, or such a
      heart as is untouched by the widow&rsquo;s agony, unmoved by the orphan&rsquo;s tears.
      He was mean, sordid, and vindictive; had realized much wealth; but on that
      ill-acquired money, the bitter curses of many a ruined family were
      entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josiah&rsquo;s appearance was very remarkable. As for as respected height, he
      was tall enough for a grenadier, and in his fleshy proportions, light
      enough for a jockey. His hollow cheek and small grey eyes were in good
      keeping with his gaunt and bony figure; and at a look the stranger would
      set him down a knave, a miser, or a union of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never were two persons more opposite in disposition than the brothers. The
      lawyer listened without emotion to a tale of sorrow&mdash;human suffering
      was a matter of indifference to him; while the soldier&rsquo;s heart was as open
      as his honest countenance, and his purse answered the appeal of poverty to
      the fullest extent of his means. Unrelieved, no beggar left his door; and
      when a comrade eame that way, then indeed the fatted calf was killed,&mdash;for
      with him my father would have shared his last flask, ay, and his last
      shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years passed away. My sixteenth summer came. My father still remained a
      widower: and no home from which its chief comfort had been taken, could be
      happier than our cottage was. Time had softened the sorrow which my
      mother&rsquo;s death had caused; and while the old soldier often alluded to his
      loss, he blessed Heaven that my brother and myself had been spared to be
      the stay and comfort of life&rsquo;s winter. Alas! he little dreamed that by
      both he would be deserted; and tinder circumstances whieh would render his
      bereavement additionally distressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in October. The few visitors who, during the bathing season,
      made the village a temporary abode, had taken their departure. The hamlet
      was left to its retirement&mdash;and our quiet course of life was
      unvaried, except by incidents of the humblest character. The soldier&rsquo;s
      kind and charitable disposition had long endeared him to the
      neighbourhood; and where he went, the prayer of the poor man followed.
      With the lawyer, avarice and years kept pace&mdash;&ldquo;none cried, God bless
      him;&rdquo; for on a simple community a more detested individual never was
      inflicted, than my evil relative, Josiah Rawlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew apace; men called me handsome&mdash;and young as I was, more than
      one suitor had told his tale of humble love. But my heart had never yet
      been touched; my breast was free from care; and with me, as yet, sorrow
      was only known by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother had just completed his eighteenth year; and a finer lad was
      never the pride and envy of a village. He was tall, handsome, and
      athletic. Among the prettiest girls, William was the object of rustic
      rivalry; and in every manly exercise, the men admitted him to be their
      superior. And then he was so good-natured and so fearless!&mdash;at one
      moment fondling some playful infant in his arms; at another, when the
      elements were in their wildest uproar, and the sea broke in thunder on the
      beach, he would be seen launching the life-boat through a boiling surf, to
      save some drowning mariner, although to all but the daring spirits who
      accompanied him, the effort seemed to be equally perilous and unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few days passed over without some acquaintance calling at the cottage; and
      all were weleome but one&mdash;our uncle. The lawyer&rsquo;s visits were
      unfrequent. He never eame excepting when he was the bearer of some evil
      news, or the retailer of some country scandal. If an honest villager was
      struck with poverty, Josiah Rawlings narrated the misfortune, and always
      imputed what had occurred to some misconduct of the sufferer. If calumny
      breathed upon a woman&rsquo;s fame, the lawyer painted her offending in its
      blackest colours, and perverted facts to give the rumour confirmation.
      Whenever Josiah entered, the peace and quiet of our happy home were
      broken. On no one point could my father and my uncle agree. While they
      were together, the time was passed in captious argument; and their parting
      was frequently in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One autumn evening the noise of a passing vehicle brought me to the
      window, and I saw a carriage pull up at the Rose and Crown. My unele had
      been about to inflict one of his unwelcome visits on his brother; but he
      stopped in the street, peering after the post-chaise, until he saw the
      passenger alight and enter the inn. The commonest occurrences never failed
      to excite his curiosity; and in a village where a stranger was rarely
      seen, the arrival of one who travelled post, was indeed an event that
      caused a general sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who that chap is who put up at Jobson&rsquo;s. All I could make out
      was that he was wrapped up in a blue cloak, and wore a cap with a gold
      band and tassel. I wish I knew his name, and what his business is,&rdquo; and
      the lawyer having settled himself upon a chair, took hold of the Geneva
      bottle, and proceeded to compound his punch. &ldquo;You heard,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;that the Hotham bank failed yesterday? Smith, the grocer, round the
      corner, had a hundred in their notes. He&rsquo;s ruined!&mdash;serve him right.
      What business had he to take them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven comfort him, poor fellow!&rdquo; ejaculated the quartermaster. &ldquo;More
      is the pity that misfortune should light upon an honest and industrious
      man, with a young family to support, and his wife dying of consumption.
      From the bottom of my heart I pity him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice business of Patty Meadows&rsquo;s, too. I always foretold what
      would happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a villanous fabrication!&rdquo; exclaimed my father, passionately; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe a syllable of the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All true,&rdquo; returned the lawyer, &ldquo;all true. Last Saturday evening, George
      Gripe, my clerk, heard the squire&rsquo;s voiee as he passed the garden; so he
      clapped his ear close to the fence, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven it had been nailed against the paling,&rdquo; said the
      soldier; &ldquo;the sneaking eaves-dropping scoundrel! Were I to catch him
      skulking about my house, I would break every rib in his carcase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and render yourself liable to an action. Gripp would get sweeping
      damages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse your damages!&rdquo; returned the quarter-master. &ldquo;Every body wonders
      that you employ a ruffian who swears black or white as bidden, and
      swallows oaths as he would bolt poached eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep him,&rdquo; said the lawyer, coolly, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s useful. What capital
      stuff that Hollands is? Does Bill run it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run it! What&mdash;smuggle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to be sure,&rdquo; returned my worthy uncle. &ldquo;I hear he&rsquo;s the boldest
      boatman on the coast; and they tell me that he saved the shipwrecked
      Dutchman, when all had given him up as lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one thing,&rdquo; replied the soldier, proudly, &ldquo;to rescue a drowning
      man;&mdash;to rob the revenue, another. My son is no smuggler, Josh; nor
      ever will be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool he, then; there&rsquo;s money to be made that way, and nothing to be
      got by the other, but bruised bones and a drenched jacket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing gotten!&rdquo; exclaimed the honest quarter-master. &ldquo;Is the grateful
      outbreaking of the heart of her to whom my boy&rsquo;s gallantry has restored a
      husband&mdash;or the prayer of lisping childhood for him who saved a
      father,&mdash;are these nothing? What is money acquired by dishonesty, to
      these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer grinned sarcastically. &ldquo;Tears and gratitude!&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;Will tears and gratitude pay rent?&mdash;will tears and gratitude pay
      taxes? You&rsquo;re a fool, Dick. I would rather have a five-pound note than the
      united prayers of the parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; replied the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you may,&rdquo; returned the miser. &ldquo;But for your own folly you might
      have made a fortune, and be now as wealthy as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid I were, Josh! if by the same means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo; inquired the lawyer, with a bitter smile. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the
      soldier, coolly, &ldquo;just because when Death tapped at the door, I should
      feel rather uncomfortable at the visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of Death; I hate to hear him mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I speak only of an old acquaintance. Like friends, we have often
      looked each other in the face. He passed me by; and when he calls in form&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;have done; I hate prosing over an unpleasant
      subject. What has your daring done for you? For one guinea you can show, I
      can count down a score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the quarter-master, proudly, &ldquo;mine are few in number, but they
      are worth yours, twice told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear the reason,&rdquo; said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis simple,&rdquo; returned my father. &ldquo;On every coin I&rsquo;m owner of, I can look
      full-front and say, &lsquo;Have I not earned you honestly?&rsquo; But yours, Josh; if
      widows&rsquo; sighs and orphans&rsquo; tears alloyed the metal, d&mdash;&mdash;n me,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      quarter-master swore as they formerly swore in Flanders,&mdash;&ldquo;nineteen
      out of every twenty you possess would be declared regular raps, and nailed
      to the counter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; said the lawyer, testily. &ldquo;You have lived a fool, and will die a
      fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived,&rdquo; said the quarter-master, calmly, &ldquo;an honest man; and I&rsquo;ll
      die a stout one, too. When the order comes, it shall be willingly obeyed.
      Mine, Josh, shall not be a felon&rsquo;s hardihood, but the humble dependency of
      one who believes that mercy is great, and faults will be forgiven. Now,
      Josh, were old bare-bones at your elbow&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Confound such nonsense!&rdquo;
       cried the lawyer, pushing his unfinished glass away, and catching up his
      hat hastily. As he crossed the threshold, his murmurings were any thing
      but prayers; and when the door closed, peace seemed to return again, and
      all of us felt that &ldquo;something wicked&rdquo; had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, my father went out according to his custom, and he was
      absent longer than usual. When he returned, it was announced that lie had
      formed an acquaintance with the stranger, whose advent had not only roused
      my uncle&rsquo;s curiosity, but created a general sensation throughout the
      hamlet. My father informed us, that his young friend was a lieutenant in a
      light dragoon regiment; his name, Seymour; his connexions, noble; and,
      more important still, that he, the quarter-master, had asked him to
      dinner, and that the invitation was freely accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour the stranger came. His appearance was very
      prepossessing,&mdash;his manners those of a man who had moved in good
      society;&mdash;and there was, besides, an easiness in his address that
      dispelled my timidity, and placed us on terms of intimacy at once. That
      evening, the foundation of an ill-omened attachment was laid. Seymour had
      established himself in the good opinions of my father and myself; and no
      one was better able to turn a favourable impression to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast had scarcely ended on the morrow, when my uncle dropped in. He
      was dying to be informed of every particular we had learned concerning the
      stranger; and, unluckily, our scanty stock of information was anything but
      satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hang it!&rdquo; said Josiah Rawlings, &ldquo;have you given that chap dinner and
      drink, and made out nothing in return for the outlay, but that he calls
      himself Seymour, and says that he&rsquo;s a dragoon? I don&rsquo;t believe either
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one syllable,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; returned my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; responded Josiah, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very easy to tell a lie; and sometimes,
      also, very convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! nonsense,&rdquo; said the quarter-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore,&rdquo; pursued the lawyer, &ldquo;do you believe the fellow&rsquo;s what he
      says he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, because his language and manners are those of a gentleman; and
      secondly, because he has the air and carriage of a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could come nearer to the mark,&rdquo; returned Josiah, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you? Well, then, what do <i>you</i> suppose the stranger is?&rdquo; The
      lawyer looked suspiciously around him; and then, in a lowered voice,
      slowly replied, &ldquo;A highwayman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father burst into a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you may laugh,&rdquo; observed Josiah, &ldquo;but I am not far astray, for all
      that. Bless you! trust nothing to appearances. I have known a footpad pass
      current for a lord; and, for two reasons, I know I&rsquo;m right about that chap
      at the Rose and Crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may these reasons be?&rdquo; asked the quarter-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; replied the lawyer, &ldquo;he has plenty of money; and second, he has
      no marks upon his linen. It&rsquo;s stolen, you may depend upon it, and the
      initials carefully picked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how the devil can you know any thing regarding either the contents of
      his purse or his baggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! leave me to scent out things. I made George Gripp bribe the
      chambermaid. It cost me two pints of ale and a shilling; but she let the
      eat out of the bag. They&rsquo;ll try his portmanteau tomorrow morning, when he
      goes to the Cliffs. George thinks he has a key at home that will fit the
      lock exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father sprang from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I have always despised, but never hated you till
      now. Is there no blush upon your cheek? Look, man, mine is burning! By
      Heaven! I&rsquo;ll mar your villany. The stranger shall know all; and if that
      caitiff ventures&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the lawyer noticed the unusual warmth of my father, he grew pale.
      &ldquo;Softly, softly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are so weak, Dick. You overdose one with
      that silliness which you call honesty. I was but half jesting. Why should
      I bother myself about the fellow? But&mdash;look to that young lady
      there!&rdquo; and with a malignant side-glance at my father and myself, he
      shuffled through the door-way, muttering and cursing, as was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the stranger&rsquo;s secret might have been, it remained at that time
      undiscovered. In person, he received his letters at the postoffice; and as
      the patent lock with which his portmanteau was secured resisted all
      attempts to open it, at the end of a fortnight, the chambermaid might have
      been a sadder but not a wiser woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another year came round; I ripened into womanhood, and early promises of
      beauty were confirmed. The stranger appeared again, but his coming now was
      not so startling in effect as formerly. For six months after his
      departure, Josiah Rawlings had carefully perused the &ldquo;Hue and Cry,&rdquo; but
      found that no highwayman answered the description. Now, mercifully
      abandoning his charge of felony, the lawyer opined that the stranger had
      merely bolted from his creditors. He might have also passed the interval
      in jail; if so, a change of air would be both useful and agreeable. And
      thus, Josiah accounted as he thought satisfactorily for Seymour&rsquo;s
      re-appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intimacy was renewed. The flattering praises bestowed upon me as a
      girl, were changed into declarations of passionate attachment; and I
      returned his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the eventful period of my life&mdash;my brother was absent, and the
      quarter-master occupied generally with friends at home, or in the
      arrangement of some village differences. Hence the intimacy of Seymour and
      myself was unrestricted; and in a short time he obtained over my young
      affections a complete ascendancy. And yet our course of love, even from
      the beginning, did not run smooth. Our relative positions in society were
      far removed: I, the daughter of an humble soldier&mdash;he, the younger
      son of a family old* as the Conquest, and high and haughty even beyond
      what their ancient lineage would warrant. Could it be expected by me that
      they would approve of their kinsman&rsquo;s choice, and receive a relative with
      neither birth nor fortune to recommend her, and whose sole possession was
      a blameless reputation and an honest name? Seymour himself, undesignedly,
      betrayed a similar uneasiness, hinting that it might be advisable to break
      the matter by degrees, and cautiously prepare his family for the
      disclosure. To effect this important object, a secret marriage would be
      necessary. His interests must be dear to me as to himself. It was a proof
      of my confidence in him that circumstances demanded,&mdash;and one, if
      given, that would bind him to me for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will not woman when she loves?&rdquo; Would not a village girl, influenced
      by a first passion, listen favourably to a suitor&rsquo;s pleading, and consult
      the heart rather than the judgment? For me Seymour had forsaken rank and
      wealth, and perilled the displeasure of his family; and should I not, in
      return, sacrifice largely where his interests were involved? Love&rsquo;s
      sophistry was unanswerable. I gave a timid consent,&mdash;we were united
      in another parish; and so well had arrangements been made to ensure
      concealment, that, with the exception of one chosen friend, to all besides
      our marriage remained a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this occurrence my father had not the most remote suspicion; and
      William&rsquo;s absence from home gave us facilities for frequent meetings that
      could not otherwise have happened. For a fortnight, Seymour continued a
      nominal lodger at the Rose and Crown,&mdash;but most of his time was
      passed in my society. At my father&rsquo;s table he had a constant place, while
      the honest quarter-master little dreamed that in his high-born guest he
      might have claimed a son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of sorrow was at hand. Letters,&mdash;most unwelcome ones,&mdash;were
      received. My husband seemed heavily depressed; and when urged to tell the
      cause of his uneasiness, mentioned that he had been suddenly recalled to
      join his regiment, and apprised me that the term of his absence was
      dependent upon some military movements; and consequently, that his return
      must be uncertain. This unexpected separation caused me the first real
      sorrow I had yet endured; and, alas! harbingered too faithfully, the
      misery and misfortunes which followed in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the head of my ill-starred parent, it was fated that the phial of
      wrath should be poured; and, sadder still, the first blow that smote him,
      came from the hand of one who would have laid down life to avert an hour
      of suffering from a father he loved so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother returned; the quarter-master had shaken him by the hand,&mdash;I,
      pressed him to my heart,&mdash;and our cottage once more looked what it
      had ever been&mdash;the abiding place of peace and joy. As evening closed,
      William strolled to his favourite haunt, the cliffs; my father pulled in
      his easy chair, lighted his pipe, and settled himself in humble luxury
      beside a well-trimmed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I retired to my own room. Mine were indeed melancholy musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recalled to memory how brief the period of my wedded happiness had been,
      and sighed to think that in the story of a human life, bliss and misery
      should be so intimately blended. But I was young, and &ldquo;gay hope by fancy
      fed&rdquo; whispered that there was happiness in store. I rallied my spirits,&mdash;wiped
      every trace of sorrow from my cheek,&mdash;and, in another hour, was
      seated opposite my dear father, and plying my needle as demurely as if I
      had never listened to a light dragoon, nor given my hand and heart
      irrevocably away, and sealed that imprudence by a secret ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footstep approached the cottage,&mdash;the latch was lifted,&mdash;and
      the slender figure of the lawyer filled the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not busy, Dick?&rdquo; croaked my uncle Josiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only with my pipe,&rdquo; replied my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll sit down a little, and take a drop of your Geneva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose,&mdash;handed my uncle a chair,&mdash;Josiah took off&rsquo; his hat, and
      seated himself The lawyer having mixed his grog, I resumed my needle-work.
      Since Seymour had left, never had my heart felt lighter than it did that
      evening; but from the moment my dreaded uncle announced himself, a weight
      seemed pressing on my bosom; for every time he spoke, like a serpent&rsquo;s
      breath, Josiah&rsquo;s words seemed to wither the happiness of all who heard
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where that fellow you were so fond of went to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fellow?&rdquo; replied the quarter-master, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Seymour, as he called himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make you happy on that head. Lieutenant Seymour has gone to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      Give me another light, Julia. Pipes now-a-days, are not what they used to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, where did Seymour go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to?&rdquo; and the quarter-master gave a puff. &ldquo;His regiment, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever news his last letters brought, egad!&rdquo; said Josiah, &ldquo;it regularly
      upset him. Mrs. Manby told me privately, that he turned pale when he read
      them; and he must have been confoundedly astonished, for he left the
      change out of half-a-crown upon the counter. I wonder what it will turn
      out to be? I think it will be debt; but George Gripp sticks to Ills first
      opinion, and says he&rsquo;s sure it will prove felony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not calmly listen while such infamous imputations were thrown out
      against the man I loved, but rose and left the room, and, retiring to my
      own apartment, I communed with my own sad thoughts, and asked myself
      whether Seymour could be aught but what my fancy pictured him. One
      moment&rsquo;s reflection established him firmly in my estimation; and every
      insinuation to his disadvantage faded from my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the easement, and looked pensively on the little flower garden
      beneath the window. How often had I watched impatiently where I stood now,
      until the trysting hour arrived, and my husband came stealing through the
      shrubbery to whisper in my delighted ear assurances of endless love!
      Suddenly a noise among the bushes startled me; a figure approached and
      stopped below the window; it was my brother. In a low voiee he told me to
      be silent, and next moment sprang into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remarked that his manner was hurried, and his faee flushed, as if from
      some violent exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, William? Speak; are you ill? Has there been an
      accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear, Julia,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I have committed myself by
      intermeddling in another&rsquo;s quarrel. But who could look on while three men
      were assailing one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alarm me, William; go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was rambling homewards from the cliffs; I heard three or four shots in
      the direction of the landing-place; and suspecting that smugglers were at
      work, I hastened off in another direction, lest any suspicion might attach
      itself to me. My anxiety to avoid it, however, brought on an unfortunate
      collision. I heard a noise approaching loud and angry voices, oaths, and
      blows, and the clashing of cutlasses succeeded&mdash;and hastening on, at
      a turning of the path I ascertained the cause. The fight was most unequal,
      for three persons were attacking a solitary man. I joined the weak side,
      stretched two of our opponents on the ground, the third ran off, and for
      the first time, I found that the man I rescued was Frank Brown. He wrung
      my hand; muttered his hurried thanks; and then bounded like a deer across
      the heath, and vanished in the Miller&rsquo;s coppice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kissed my brother ardently. &ldquo;Well, William, English blood is warm&mdash;and
      who eould look on and not assist a brave man when assailed by numbers?
      Would, however, that it had been some other; Red Frank is such a desperado&mdash;a
      branded man&mdash;a felon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, girl, but was he not the first to jump into the life-boat after me,
      when we saved the drowning Dutchman? I owed him, devil as he is, a good
      turn for his gallantry. For rescuing him I care nothing; but I fear that
      blood was spilled already upon the beach. The pistol shots, and the
      desperate haste with which Red Frank escaped, lead me to dread that some
      previous violence had occurred. Who is below, Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, and my unele.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! I hear hasty footsteps; slip down, Julia, and probably you may hear
      if any accident has happened. I would not alarm my father unnecessarily
      until we know whether the affray was serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed my brother&rsquo;s wishes, and returned to the parlour. We heard men
      without; they seemed excited, spoke fast, and hurried rapidly along the
      street. Presently a knock was heard; I opened the door,&mdash;it was
      Gripp, my uncle&rsquo;s clerk. He had come here to seek his master, and one
      glance at the evil agent of the lawyer, told that he was the bearer of
      heavy news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; said Josiah, eagerly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; The lawyer never
      asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing pertikler,&rdquo; returned my uncle&rsquo;s satellite; &ldquo;only one man is
      murdered, and half a dozen nearly killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;where&mdash;how?&rdquo; asked my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, down at the Tinker&rsquo;s Cove; a row between smugglers and revenue men.
      Red Frank shot Nat Davis through the heart&mdash;and he was all but taken,
      when a comrade floored two officers, and Frank gave leg-bail to the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! that makes the other fellow an accessory after the fact; he&rsquo;ll hang,
      that&rsquo;s certain. Is he known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Gripp answered with a wink; the wink was an affirmative one.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name? Will he be able to fee counsel, and employ a solicitor?&rdquo;
       inquired the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gripp winked affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One very like your own.&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father started&mdash;&ldquo;Speak, fellow, who was the murderer&rsquo;s comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; returned the bailiff, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son? William Rawlings? &rsquo;tis false, by Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it, Dick,&rdquo; observed my precious uncle, &ldquo;that George
      Gripp is well-informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father drooped his head&mdash;I sprang from my chair and folded him in
      my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis false! my father&mdash;believe <i>me</i>, the charge is false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were,&rdquo; replied Josiah, in a tone that showed his incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Heaven!&rdquo; murmured the poor quarter-master; &ldquo;and is the son I
      loved so dearly, branded as accomplice to a murderer? Did my William
      consort with desperate men, and engage in lawless enterprise? I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it,&rdquo; returned the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk; &ldquo;I have it from the
      best authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mv father turned wildly to my uncle&mdash;&ldquo;Josh! speak, man! have heart,
      for once, and say if what that scoundrel says may be credited. You shake
      your head; well, if the misfortune has occurred, what will be its worst
      consequences? Can you tell? even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell?&rdquo; returned the lawyer; &ldquo;ay, and with as much certainty, as if the
      foreman of the jury had delivered a verdict &lsquo;for self and fellows.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with the worst, man,&rdquo; gasped my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be hanged, that&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; responded the lawyer, with a decision
      that forbad all argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged! my William hanged! Hanged as a felon, and share an outlaw&rsquo;s fate,
      with one familiarized to crime, and grown grey in iniquity&mdash;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say,&rdquo; said Josiah coolly, &ldquo;that their sentences would be the
      same. Ned Frank will probably be gibbeted for example&mdash;but Bill may&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quarter-master buried his head within his hands, and murmured, &ldquo;My
      son! my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; responded a voice, and my brother clasped the old man in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment passed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this foul story true, William&rsquo; said the quarter-master, and in tones
      which seemed to dread an answer to the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;False as hell!&rdquo; was boldly responded, and again the son was locked more
      closely in his father&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tale is short. Accident brought me to the cliffs; I witnessed an
      unequal conflict&mdash;one man was assailed by three&mdash;and I joined
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;by Heaven!&rdquo; and for the first time my father lifted his head
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the weaker side, and as it would appear, I undesignedly have
      rescued a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can support that statement by evidence, I&rsquo;ll undertake,&rdquo; said the
      lawyer, &ldquo;to get you off with transportation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with the Devil!&rdquo; roared my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother smiled. &ldquo;Well, uncle, you hold out a pleasant prospect, and
      after I have travelled at the public expense, I shall feel myself bound in
      gratitude to come back, improved in morals and manners, and tell you what
      I have seen; but after all, there will be no necessity to undertake the
      voyage. When the true history of this unfortunate affray is known, it will
      not be difficult to prove that I am blameless, and that I was neither
      engaged in unlawful enterprises, nor knew aught of the fatal consequences
      that followed. For a time, however, I will leave home, not from any fears
      upon my own account, but to avoid the painful duty of being called upon to
      criminate the guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all, my brother&rsquo;s determination seemed right. My kind-hearted parent
      approved the motives, and gave a ready consent. The lawyer observed, that
      it would afford ample time, should it be found advisable, to buy off the
      evidence; while George Gripp proved the value of a friend in need, by
      volunteering to swear an alibi himself,&mdash;an offer which elicited a
      warm eulogium from his virtuous patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half-an-hour William came to my room to say farewell, he had made up
      some necessaries in a bundle, which he threw from the window to a friend,
      who was waiting for him in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; he said, taking me in his arms, and kissing me with ardent
      affection; &ldquo;Julia, I must confide to you what would pain our dear father,
      were it told to him&mdash;mine will not be a temporary absence. No tears,
      Julia; be firm, and listen to a brother who loves you tenderly as I do.
      The hand of destiny beckons me on; for months I have been wretched; while
      every post bears tidings of some glorious deed, I, in the pride of youth,
      am dreaming life away; my days passed idling on the beach, or listening at
      some cottage fire-side to the gossip of the humble villagers. This evening
      as I stood upon the cliffs, I saw a noble frigate close in shore, with her
      head turned to the coast of France. The wind fell, not a breath ruffled
      her canvas, and as she lay motionless on the sea, I could almost look down
      upon her decks. Presently a boat was lowered, and it pulled directly for
      the cove a league eastward from our landing-place, to obtain fresh water
      at the spring. Before that boat returns, I shall have time to board the
      frigate. Hold, Julia; nothing can shake that resolution, and, therefore,
      listen to me attentively. When I am gone, <i>you</i> must be to our father
      all&mdash;for then you will be his only stay, his only comfort. You must
      watch his declining years, cheer him when he droops, smile with him when
      he&rsquo;s happy in illness, your task will be to smooth his pillow; in death,
      your hand must close his eyes. Come, Julia, no weeping. If it be fated
      that I fall, except you and the old man, few will weep for me. If I
      return, it will be &lsquo;with war&rsquo;s red honours on my crest,&rsquo; to gladden my
      father&rsquo;s age, and find some one to whom I can safely entrust thy
      happiness, dear Julia&mdash;one, who can estimate the value of a woman,
      whose thoughts are pure and cloudless as the light of yonder blessed
      moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My conscience smote me bitterly as William again pressed me to his breast;
      I felt the burning blush of shame steal over my pale cheeks, as my heart
      whispered how much I had deceived that brother, who believed me incapable
      of artifice or concealment; and though the confession of my offence must
      be humiliating, I determined that it should be made. From him I might not
      only ask for pardon, but advice; and the words were almost upon my lips,
      when suddenly a voice from below was heard in under tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;the signal&rsquo;s given. See, that rocket
      bursting in the air! the boat&rsquo;s returning to the frigate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, there&rsquo;s not a moment to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! my brother,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;stop, for pity&rsquo;s sake. Oh! I have much,
      very much to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught me warmly to his bosom; kissed me again and again; whispered in
      my ear: &ldquo;Look to our father, Julia&mdash;and wed not till I return, or
      till you hear I am no more.&rdquo; lie said, sprang lightly from the window,
      bounded across the garden hedge, and in another minute, the sounds of
      receding footsteps died away, and all was night and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hour when William departed, sorrow and misfortune seemed to
      choose our cottage for an abiding place. Letters through a private hand
      came from Seymour; but, alas! they brought no consolation with them. The
      affected indifference of the style, and the inconsistency of the
      statements, gave sad evidence that the writer was diseased in mind, or
      body, or in both. The fatal affray which had unluckily compromised my
      brother&rsquo;s character for a time, and occasioned the necessity for his
      concealment, was supposed to be sufficient cause for my being desponding
      and depressed; and my poor father, ignorant of impending misery, and
      unconscious of the trials that awaited him, vainly endeavoured to dispel
      my melancholy, and remove all fears upon account of William. As he had
      foretold himself, his innocence was completely established; and those who
      were bitterly exasperated against the real offenders, bore honourable
      testimony to the motives that had induced my brother to commit himself;
      and while they regretted that through his intervention a criminal had
      escaped, they admitted that his conduct had been that of a man, who, under
      mistaken views, performs a brave and generous action. No offence was
      imputed to him now, and wherefore should he stay away longer? But, I knew
      too well that many a long month must elapse before the wanderer would
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a part of my evening&rsquo;s occupation to read the newspaper to my
      father; and a fortnight after William&rsquo;s departure, I was engaged in my
      customary duty. An event had occurred in London to which public attention
      seemed to have been painfully directed, and the paper contained a long
      statement, headed, &ldquo;Farther particulars of the forgeries and suicide
      committed by Captain Smith.&rdquo; The details thus given, stated that the
      unfortunate individual was the illegitimate offspring of a noble lord,
      whose name was mentioned. That early in life he had obtained a commission
      in the army,&mdash;had moved in the best circles,&mdash;indulged in
      fashionable follies,&mdash;and dissipated large sums of money, with which,
      from time to time, his father had supplied him. The earl died suddenly,
      leaving his natural son totally unprovided for; and he was thus thrown
      upon the world, with incurable habits of expense, and not a guinea to
      support them. His fall was consequently rapid. He sold his commission,
      spent its small produce in a short time, dropped step by step from the
      high position he once held,&mdash;and in fast succession became a gambler,
      a cheat, a forger, and a suicide! His delinquencies were detected. The
      officers of justice were already at the door of a mean lodging in which he
      had concealed himself, when the criminal contrived to get out of a back
      window and effect a temporary escape. But it was only to add crime to
      crime. His clothes, next morning, were found upon the bank of the river
      near Wandsworth, and beside them lay an empty phial, which it was
      ascertained had contained a deadly poison; and it was conjectured that the
      unfortunate suicide had swallowed the contents before he took the fatal
      plunge. It was, indeed, a melancholy story of profligate life; for, it was
      added, that an imposing person and fascinating address had been turned to
      a bad account; and that many a family had reason to curse the day on which
      the accomplished <i>roué</i>, had been introduced to their acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not tell wherefore, but as I read this miserable narrative, my
      blood chilled, my lips grew white, and I could scarcely reach its close.
      And yet, why should it affect me? Was it not an every-day event? the
      regular advance of crime&mdash;beginning with improvidence, and ending in
      ignominy and death. But still the story of the suicide seemed to haunt my
      memory; and sleeping or waking, the unknown criminal constantly was
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the third evening after. My father had accepted a neighbour&rsquo;s
      invitation; and I, preferring solitude to a scene of rustic festivity, for
      which a heavy heart was badly suited, was left alone at home. As usual, I
      was sitting in the window of my own chamber,&mdash;that window from which
      I had watched a lover&rsquo;s coming, and witnessed a brother&rsquo;s departure; and
      lost in painful reveries, allowed hours to slip unnoticed. The moon had
      gone down; the night was unusually dark; and the stillness was unbroken. I
      heard the dry leaves rustle; was it the wind that moved them? I looked
      suspiciously abroad; a human figure was standing underneath, and a voice
      so hoarse and hollow that I could not recognise its tones, softly
      pronounced my name. I flung the casement open, and demanded, &ldquo;who was
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Julia; your lover, your husband,&rdquo; and Seymour in another minute held
      me nearly fainting in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was my voice forgotten, Julia?&rdquo; he murmured, half reproachfully.
      &ldquo;Well, I cannot wonder at it, for I have been ill, and am hoarse as a
      raven. How cold the night is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold! Why, Edward, your hand is burning. Stay, I will bring lights, and
      get you some refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he answered, hastily; &ldquo;no lights, love; some curious eye might
      observe them. But I am thirsty; I could drink, drink deeply. Bring me some
      wine, Julia; no supper, love&mdash;I cannot eat, I am weary, very weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And was this Seymour? that hollow voice the same, to whose soft pleadings
      I had yielded a young heart, and renounced the sacred allegiance which a
      father claims and merits? That fevered hand, too,&mdash;was it the ardent
      glow which warms the husband when he hastens to the home of her he loves?
      Why this strange fancy for darkness and concealment? The coming and the
      conduct of Seymour were equally mysterious, and I dreaded to ask my
      husband the cause of this ominous and unexpected return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not left long in suspense,&mdash;Seymour half drained the flask;&mdash;and
      habits so temperate before, appeared to have undergone a rapid change; for
      he drank like a man whose shattered nerves require some powerful stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you did not expect this visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor when I left you did I anticipate that my return would be so sudden.
      Circumstances, which for a time must remain unexplained, have rendered it
      imperative that I should claim you, and our marriage no longer shall be
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, Julia, you shall go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night! impossible! My father&rsquo;s proud, he never would consent that his
      daughter should steal from her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father? He shall know nothing of it. No, Julia, we must leave the
      cottage privately; and, for a brief season, duty to the parent must give
      place to the stronger claims of wedded love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I dreaming? Seymour,&mdash;what would you have me do? Desert my father
      heartlessly, and leave the good old man without humbling myself at his
      feet, and begging the pardon I require,&mdash;the forgiveness he would
      grant? Fly from this once happy home!&mdash;&lsquo;Twould break my father&rsquo;s
      heart.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Julia, we part for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part for ever! Seymour. Do I hear aright? Is this, indeed, your voice?
      and do <i>you</i> tell her who proved her love at the expense of filial
      duty, that she must either fly from her home like a guilty woman, or be
      deserted by the man who led her into error?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seymour perceived the threat of parting had produced a different effect to
      what he had expected, and at once he changed his tone to that of entreaty
      and persuasion; and, with admirable tact, appealed to my feelings and my
      love. He pleaded that the separation from my father would be but brief. I
      should return united to one whose position in society was far above my
      own. My parent&rsquo;s anger would be shortlived, and his sorrow would be turned
      into joy. Where a woman&rsquo;s heart is advocate, her mind is easily convinced.
      I yielded a reluctant consent; and before we parted, it was arranged that
      in two hours I should be ready to accompany him, and quit a happy home to
      follow the fortunes of an unknown lover. I packed some clothes, and
      addressed an exculpatory letter to my father, breaking to him as gently as
      I could, the sad tidings that his daughter had deserted him. Many a tear
      blistered the paper while I wrote. He was in bed&mdash;possibly sleeping.
      I stole softly down to place the billet on his table&mdash;but he heard
      the door unclose, and inquired &ldquo;if that were Julia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my father; I come to say, Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man kissed me tenderly; and with unusual solemnity muttered as I
      left the room, &ldquo;Child of my heart; may God for ever bless thee!&rdquo; They were
      the last words I ever heard him speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      What followed may be briefly told. At the appointed hour Seymour was
      waiting, and unperceived, we quitted the village in a vehicle he had
      procured. We travelled all night; and when morning was breaking, my
      husband discharged the cart, and we entered an obscure inn to obtain the
      rest and refreshment which to both were wanting. The morning light, feeble
      at first, grew stronger; and I nearly fainted, when for the first time I
      remarked the altered appearance of my husband. His light brown hair, once
      so sedulously attended to, was clipped short, and the very colour changed
      to raven blackness, and his skin was bronzed like that of a gipsy.
      Formerly, he dressed with simple elegance; but now his clothes were
      actually shabby, and put on with the marked indifference of a man who is
      reckless of appearances. He had no luggage with him&mdash;the few articles
      he possessed were tied up in a little bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt assured that some terrible reverse had overtaken him; and in this
      sad hour recollected the evil auguries of my uncle Josiah. But my
      situation was hopeless. The last rash action was far beyond recall; and
      mustering a desperate resolution, I determined to bow to my destiny, and
      share the fate of my ill-starred husband. One thing I believed, that the
      worst was known, and we had descended fortune&rsquo;s ladder to the lowest step.
      I was wrong: the extent of my debasement remained still to be disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We appeared to wander over the country without any settled object; and
      provided the route led from the metropolis, my husband seemed indifferent
      whither our footsteps turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight passed, and we still continued to pursue what appeared to me
      would prove a sad and endless pilgrimage. One evening, after a fatiguing
      walk, we found ourselves settled in a road-side ale-house. Both required
      some rest, and we looked forward to a comfortable night, for the house was
      clean, and our reception had been civil. Alas! we had already experienced
      how much an inn&rsquo;s civility depends upon the appearance of those who claim
      admittance! Our resources were reduced to a few pounds; and my soiled
      dress and Seymour&rsquo;s care-worn countenance proclaimed our poverty at once,
      and by more than one landlord we had been unceremoniously rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      While supper was being prepared, Seymour stretched himself upon a bench
      beneath a spreading elm which stood before the door, and I remained at a
      window of the room to which we had been introduced on our arrival. A
      newspaper was lying on the table. I took it up, and for a few minutes
      glanced carelessly across its columns. Suddenly, my attention was
      fearfully awakened, my eyes were fascinated to one spot,&mdash;a scorching
      lire shot through my brain,&mdash;I read the fatal paragraph a second
      time,&mdash;fainted,&mdash;and dropped upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I recovered I found myself in bed; Seymour was beside me; I looked
      wildly at him for a moment, and then, as if something horrible had blasted
      my sight, I buried my head beneath the coverings; Seymour knelt beside the
      bed, implored me to be calm, swore he would conceal nothing, owned he was
      a scoundrel, a betrayer&mdash;his life was at my disposal&mdash;and the
      sooner it was forfeited the better. After I had been carried to my room he
      had searched the paper, and read there that fatal paragraph which had
      disclosed to me the secret of his crime. Merciful Heaven! Smith, the
      supposed suicide, and my husband, were the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been supposed, that now fully conscious of his infamy, I
      would have deserted him at once and left Seymour to his fate. In seducing
      me into a private marriage, he had practised a cruel imposition; and in
      persuading me, under false assurances, to quit my father&rsquo;s house and share
      his felon fortunes, his conduct had been base and savage beyond all
      pardon. Yet, some secret yearning of my heart, whispered that he should
      not be abandoned; and though Smith, the branded criminal, was before me, I
      could not forget how ardently I had once loved the gay and fascinating
      Seymour. I had sacrificed myself to him at the altar; my vow of duty and
      obedience was recorded, and I desperately resolved to share his fate&mdash;wretched
      as that fate must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of my sad history is but a detail of sorrow and misfortune.
      I dare not dwell upon it&mdash;if I did, my brain would madden. Before six
      months elapsed after my evasion from the village, news reached England
      that the frigate into which William had entered a volunteer, in the ardour
      of pursuit, had become embayed upon the coast of France, and, attacked at
      fearful advantage, she had been fought with desperate valour to the last,
      and had gone down with England&rsquo;s unconquered banner flying at her
      mast-head, and with the greater portion of her gallant crew. In the return
      of the killed, my brother&rsquo;s name was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need I tell you that his brave boy&rsquo;s loss&mdash;his daughter&rsquo;s base
      desertion&mdash;were more than the old man could bear? They broke my
      father&rsquo;s heart; and a few months since&mdash;(she paused, gasped as if
      something choked her utterance, and then in a hollow whisper, added)&mdash;he
      died! <i>Who was his murderess?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I must end these sickening disclosures. For a year, my outcast husband and
      myself wandered over the country, under the assumed name of Montague. We
      joined a company of strollers, and in our erratic course of life we
      crossed the sea. No criminal, I sincerely believe, felt deeper contrition
      for his manifold offendings than my felon husband. The sting of remorse
      struck him to the heart; he pined away; and cold, and wet, and hunger,
      completed what mental suffering had begun, he fell into a rapid
      consumption&mdash;and it was quite evident to me that he was hurrying to
      the only haven of repose reserved for him&mdash;the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died; but death to the outcast was a boon. Faithful to the last, I
      remained until his parting sigh escaped. These hands closed his eyes; and
      I saw him interred as a pauper in the most neglected corner of an obscure
      churchyard. Had he no mourner? Yes; he had <i>one</i>. I forgot his
      crimes, and all the misery he had wrought me; and the outcast&rsquo;s deserted
      grave was sprinkled with the tears of the woman he had betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fosterer was deeply affected. He pressed the poor mourner&rsquo;s hand, and
      strove to cheer and comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What do you intend to do? Where do you purpose going?
      May I protect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes, and gave him a look of gratitude, but shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you returning home, Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed about to seek a home,&rdquo; she replied, with a long deep sigh.
      &ldquo;It must be sought beside my father&rsquo;s grave; and that once found, I&rsquo;ll die
      there! Hush! footsteps are approaching; and now to resume a weary journey,
      and&mdash;a last one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, went to the little basin, and dipping her hands in the cooling
      water, bathed her burning temples, and washed away the traces of her
      tears. Marc Antony in silence lifted the bundle, and the youthful
      travellers once more gained the high road, when two persons, wayfaring
      like themselves, approached them.

      and his companion are on the road, we must leave the man to take care of
      himself, and returning to the master, inquire whether in the interim any
      particular &ldquo;ups and downs&rdquo; had occurred in the fortunes of myself, Mr.
      Hector O&rsquo;Halloran. I was left in bed&mdash;and where could a safer place
      be found wherein to deposit a light-headed young gentleman? But every body
      knows that general rules are not without exceptions&mdash;and, the
      circumstances considered, by which I had obtained possession of the
      quaker&rsquo;s dormitory, I feel assured that the gentle reader will wish me a
      safe deliverance from the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not enter into minute details of how the false positions of myself
      and Samuel Pryme were finally detected; but in the parlance of Tony
      Lumpkin&rsquo;s respectable friend, who never danced a bear to unfashionable
      music, will sum them up in &ldquo;a concatenation accordingly,&rdquo; namely, the
      sleepy soliloquy of the chief butler of the worthy quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Costigan was one of those gifted individuals who sleep at pleasure.
      He had a light conscience and a heavy head; and it there was one mortal
      annoyance that he abominated above the rest, it was to have any portion of
      &ldquo;nature&rsquo;s sweet restorative&rdquo; abridged. Twice had his slumbers been
      invaded. He had let in one master dead drunk, and admitted the other, who
      had been belated. These were grievous visitations; but, like other
      misfortunes, they were over; and determined to make up, if possible, for
      broken sleep, Mr. Costigan once more sought his pillow, and for a season
      had been buried in &ldquo;dreamless slumberings.&rdquo; Alas! this Elysian state of
      sweet forgetfulness was presently dispelled. In successive vollies, sand
      struck the casement sharply; and &ldquo;every pause between,&rdquo; <i>a sotto voice</i>
      appeal fell sluggishly upon the sleeper&rsquo;s ear, requiring admission to the
      garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was more than flesh and blood could stand. To two masters, as we
      said before, the butler had given admission, and both were disposed of as
      Christian men should be; and, as the fact is clearly understood in
      Ireland, and upon parliamentary authority too, that nothing can be in two
      places at once&mdash;barring a bird&mdash;it was quite clear that neither
      of the Prymes could be at one and the same time in bed and in the street.
      Of course, the intruder must be a stranger: he was on the right side to
      run away, namely, the wrong side of the hall-door&mdash;and there let him
      remain. Having come to this discreet resolution, and consigned the unknown
      to the especial care of that personage more genteelly known as &ldquo;the
      gentleman in black,&rdquo; Mr. Costigan once more turned on his pillow,
      determined to all further appeals to play deaf adder, and sleep like a
      watchman during the little time now left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stranger would not be denied. A sharper volley rattled against the
      windows, and a voice came down the area, and softly but distinctly
      pronounced, &ldquo;John Costigan, I pray thee to arise, and let me in&mdash;I am
      thy friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, then, feaks,&rdquo; observed the butler with a desperate yawn, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      my own name, sure enough; but to the divil I pitch such friendship,
      whoever ye are. I see that I&rsquo;ll never stand the place; for of all the dens
      I ever was in, for a racketty hole this quaker&rsquo;s bates them hollow. Wasn&rsquo;t
      I for three months second waiter at the &lsquo;Free and asy&rsquo; in Roscrea; and
      when the Blazers would tatter the house once a fortnight, why a man could
      get a little sleep, while the damage was repairin&rsquo;; but here, there&rsquo;s
      nothing but batteration. In tumbles the young chap blind drunk, and nearly
      breaks my back carryin&rsquo; him up stairs. Then in rowls the ould sinner, just
      off the ran-tan, wid a cock-and-bull story in his mouth about a broken
      coach, to blind that stiff-backed gentlewoman that owns him. Death and
      &lsquo;nages! what a chate he is!&mdash;if one didn&rsquo;t know his trick, he might
      think butter wouldn&rsquo;t melt in his mouth&mdash;he&rsquo;s so fair spoken: the
      ould decaver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a shower of sand interrupted Mr. Costigan&rsquo;s soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy, bad luck to ye! Do you mane to smash the glass, ye thief? Wait till
      I git the breeches on, and maybe ye won&rsquo;t git a fla in ye&rsquo;r ear for
      disturbin&rsquo; an honest tradesman like myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having slipped on his nether garment, the butler unlocked the area door,
      as from that position he could hold safer converse, having the palisades
      between him and the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did an unhappy quaker find greater difficulty to establish his
      identity; for Mr. Costigan was not an impartial judge, he having already
      fully determined to reject all evidence the claimant might adduce. But one
      doubt presented itself to the worthy butler&mdash;could the person he had
      carried up to bed have been a phantom? Oh, no; the burden was &ldquo;too, too,
      solid flesh,&rdquo;&mdash;a fact his aching back attested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a truth, friend Costigan,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;I am thy master&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, <i>na boolish!</i>&rdquo; returned the incredulous pantler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the wicket,&rdquo; pursued the suppliant; &ldquo;thy look is good-natured; and
      wouldst thou expose me to my father&rsquo;s anger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, none of ye&rsquo;r soft solder with me,&rdquo; responded Mr. Costigan. &ldquo;Divil
      a toe you&rsquo;ll put into the house, good nor bad. Be off wid ye; give ye&rsquo;r
      rags a gallop, or, be this book, I&rsquo;ll charge ye on the watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loud tone in which the indignant butler repudiated the real Simon Pure
      had reached his father&rsquo;s ears, and brought the <i>tête-à-tête</i> to a
      close. The window opened; and Mr. Pryme demanded, &ldquo;What caused the noise
      beneath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Mr. Costigan; &ldquo;only here&rsquo;s a rambler on the street,
      that, right or wrong, wants me to let him in, and swares he&rsquo;s a son of
      yours into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who art thou, friend? demanded the elder quaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy erring son,&rdquo; returned a voice, choked with shame, and almost
      inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I hear?&mdash;Thou, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed a female voice; and Mrs. Pryme&rsquo;s nightcap came
      popping through another window. &ldquo;Our son Samuel is long since a-bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! one glance confirmed the identity of the applicant; and to Mr. Pryme
      the discovery was most painful&mdash;while it passed the understanding of
      Mr. Costigan altogether. Doubtingly, at the bidding of his master, the
      butler unclosed the door, while the old man descended to the hall to
      receive his erring child, and learn the particulars of an occurrence with
      which so much mystery seemed to be involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the heart of a fond father, how irresistibly come the pleadings of a
      first offence! The word of pardon passed the old man&rsquo;s lips&mdash;the
      young offender was folded in his parent&rsquo;s arms&mdash;and it would be
      doubtful to determine, whether the happier of the twain was he who
      received, or he who had extended forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was as it should be; but what the devil was to become of me?
      Indeed, my hour of retribution was at hand&mdash;for the reconciliation
      was scarcely completed, before it was intimated to Mr. Pryme, that an
      unknown guest had honoured the mansion with his company,&mdash;that he was
      at present sound asleep&mdash;that his reception had been affectionate&mdash;but
      it was not considered necessary to add, that he had received more decided
      tokens of regard, and been kissed by half the female portion of the
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ascertain who this mysterious visitor might be, Mr. Pryme proceeded at
      once to my apartment, accompanied by his henchman, Jack Costigan, who, to
      guard against danger or surprise, had provided himself with the kitchen
      poker. No ally could have been better affected than the butler; for, by
      future good service, he was anxious to redeem the error he had committed
      in rejecting an heir-apparent from his father&rsquo;s house, as unceremoniously
      as if he had been the tax-gatherer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laboured under the stupid inertion which succeeds a drunken debauch, and
      was buried in profound repose. Unheard and unchallenged, the quaker
      approached my bed, while the butler unclosed the window-shutters. The
      quaker touched my shoulder gently&mdash;and in a voice as calm as if he
      were addressing an honoured guest, inquired, &ldquo;Friend, art thou sleeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fancying that I was &lsquo;wakened by my servant to attend morning drill, I
      irreverently responded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse all parades! Tell Sergeant Skelton to go to Bath, and let the
      Adjutant go after him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear not,&rdquo; returned Mr. Pryme; &ldquo;but say, how wilt thou excuse thyself?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I replied, still dreaming of drill and duty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that to
      you: say I have a head-ache&mdash;a tooth-ache&mdash;or any ache you
      please. In short, tell any lie that will answer best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, thou dost neither comprehend my meaning, nor I thine;&rdquo; replied
      the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, Mr. Costigan managed to unclose the shutters;&mdash;a flood
      of sunshine streamed in, lightened the apartment suddenly, and at once
      dispelled my slumberings. I started, like a guilty thing, bolt upright in
      the bed, and encountered full front, the burly form of the honest quaker;
      while Mr. Costigan, poker in hand, remained some paces in the rear, ready
      to aid and support his master on the first indication of hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Obadiah Pryme&mdash;Friend, what is thine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was a regular choker. I was called on to become my own
      accuser, and stand before my father&rsquo;s chosen representative, a
      self-convicted <i>roué</i>. Of the <i>finale</i> of my career, what goodly
      promise did its opening give! my first introduction to my guardian&mdash;a
      rascally invasion of his premises,&mdash;and, were I pressed to extenuate
      the offence, I could not, with Jack Falstaff, even plead that I had not
      &ldquo;kissed the keeper&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trifles hurry on great events,&mdash;and a recommendation from Mr.
      Costigan, that I should be sent direct to Newgate, roused my latent pride,
      and re-established courage, that was oozing fast from my finger-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, John!&rdquo; returned the quaker; &ldquo;Thy name, friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is one, Sir, not unknown to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the old man, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am called Hector O&rsquo;Halloran!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Protect us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pryme, with hands and eyes upturned; &ldquo;Wert
      thou then the companion of my erring boy, and partook in last night&rsquo;s
      godless revelry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not <i>my companion</i>,&rdquo; I answered boldly; &ldquo;but <i>I</i> his
      tempter. I led him to commit the folly that he did&mdash;and the blame of
      all should rest with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quaker gave me a benignant look, took my hand, and pressed it warmly&mdash;and
      next moment my pardon was pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector O&rsquo;Halloran,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thy candour redeems thy crime. He who so
      freely owns a fault will probably henceforward eschew the ways of
      foolishness. Sleep; the morning yet is young. I am thankful that the son
      of my ancient friend was fortunately brought to a home where he was placed
      in safety. Thou shalt be called ere breakfast-hour arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the shutters were closed. The quaker departed, and I was left to
      marvel at the luck by which I had undeservedly escaped the pains and
      penalties of this my first delinquency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slumbered away two hours, dreaming of Charleys&rsquo; lanterns, poles, and
      stolen kisses, until my &ldquo;man tapped at the door&rdquo; with a carpetbag
      containing a full equipment. Indeed, it was fortunate for me that Mr.
      Pryme had sent for my servant and a refit; for the formal habiliments in
      which I had masqueraded on the preceding evening now cut a sorry figure,
      as John examined them one by one. The coat was changed into a spencer;
      for, in the <i>melée</i>, body and skirts had parted company,&mdash;while
      that garment, politely termed unmentionable, exhibited so many compound
      fractures, that the tailor would have been a daring artist who would have
      undertaken the repairs. Having completed my toilet, my valet took his
      departure, just as the quaker&rsquo;s butler announced that the ladies were
      waiting for me in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      When the summons to the breakfast-table was delivered, I felt it a first
      draft upon the assurance of a bashful Irishman, and I would have freely
      sacrificed a month&rsquo;s pay, to have been permitted to slip off without any
      flourish of trumpets. It was bad enough to face my worthy mentor,&mdash;him,
      to whom especially both my morality and expenditure had been consigned.
      But it was the quaker&rsquo;s womankind whom I had most cause to dread&mdash;ladies
      swindled out of a kiss under false pretences,&mdash;how the deuce was I to
      encounter the chaste indignation, which the recollection of that felonious
      <i>accolade</i> would assuredly call forth? My foot stuck to the last step
      of the staircase, as if it had been glued there; and there I stood, in the
      comfortable position of a person who is ashamed to retreat, and afraid to
      go forward. The chief butler, however, brought matters to a crisis.
      Emerging from the lower regions by a back stair, he entered the
      breakfast-room, and I had the satisfaction to hear him announce, in a
      voice intended only to be audible to those within, that &ldquo;the drunken
      gentleman was in the hall,&rdquo; accompanied with a-running-commentary of,
      &ldquo;What impudence some people have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark, under existing circumstances, was not an encouraging one; and
      it would have afforded me unspeakable delight to have seen Mr. Costigan
      under the bastinado. Yet nothing, indeed, but that quality which it was
      insinuated I possessed extensively, would bear me through; and, after
      invoking the powers of impudence, in I desperately ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to my offendings mercy had been extended. Had I been an expected
      visitor, Mr. Pryme&rsquo;s reception could not have been kinder,&mdash;and his
      stiff helpmate inquired, &ldquo;Had I rested well?&rdquo; Rachael,&mdash;oh! <i>how</i>
      that plain peaked muslin, which vainly strove to hide a profusion of
      auburn hair, became her! She, sweet girl, bade me a timid good-morrow, and
      then, blushing to the very brows, dropped her dovelike eyes upon the
      table-cloth. All this was passing strange&mdash;strange that the felonious
      invasion of a quiet domicile at midnight should elicit no objection&mdash;and,
      stranger still&mdash;the kiss of peace appeared to have totally escaped
      the memories of all parties save myself, implicated in the transaction!
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast ended&mdash;the old lady withdrew&mdash;and Mr. Pryme asked me
      to walk with him to his counting-house. Requesting leave of absence for
      ten minutes to arrange some domestic matters before he should leave home,
      the quaker retired from the parlour, and Rachael and I were left to
      entertain each other as we best could.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short time our mutual position was embarrassing. I did not know
      exactly what to say; and the fair puritan maintained a solemn silence,
      with her sparkling eyes fixed steadily upon the carpet. It was quite
      apparent that I was expected to lead off; and, after an awkward pause, the
      ice at last was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pryme&rdquo;&mdash;I commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; returned the young lady, &ldquo;I am not thus termed; I am simply
      called Rachael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty name!&rdquo; I replied, for want of something else to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that of my grandmother,&rdquo; returned the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Rachael,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I fear my late visit occasioned some
      confusion. Certainly the mistakes of last night were singular and
      ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were, indeed,&rdquo; replied the pretty maiden, raising her eyes, which,
      for the first time, now encountered mine; and, by a mutual impulse, we
      both burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Egad, we were thinking
      of the same thing; and the remembrance of that confounded kiss of peace
      had thus demolished the gravity of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rachael,&rdquo; I said, catching one of the prettiest hands imaginable in mine,
      &ldquo;I must confess my offence, and throw myself for pardon on your clemency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; replied the fair one, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To its fullest extent I own my crime. The temptation, dear Rachael, was
      too great to be withstood&mdash;but, as a proof of returning probity, I
      will restore what was fraudulently obtained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; returned the blushing girl, while an arch smile &lsquo;play&rsquo;d round
      her lip and brighten&rsquo;d her soft eye,&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I admire thy honesty; but I
      have heard my father say, that it is generally better to put up with a
      loss, than seek restitution by doubtful means. Therefore, my friend, we
      had better leave matters as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that I should abuse such generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector, I am ready for thee now,&rdquo; exclaimed the deep voice of Mr. Pryme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, dear Rachael; I have always heard that honesty was politic&mdash;but
      faith, I never thought till now that it was half so pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Hector,&rdquo; said the fair girl, with a look of rich <i>espièglerie</i>,
      as she hurried from the room, towards which the creaking of her father&rsquo;s
      shoes announced that he was approaching,&mdash;&ldquo;probity may be strained
      too far. For the future, content thyself with returning what thou owest,
      but add not interest to the debt that even a usurer would scruple to
      receive. Farewell. May thy honesty continue; for sudden conversions are
      always suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran, laughing, from the apartment; and, in a few moments, Mr. Pryme
      summoned me to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his counting-house I found a packet which had arrived from my father by
      the morning&rsquo;s post; and with surprise I found that it contained an order
      for my starting for London without delay. He had been privately apprised
      by a friend in the War-office, that an exchange might be effected with a
      lieutenant who was about to quit the Peninsula, from ill health. This
      would give me the full step; and I was directed to obtain a leave between
      returns&mdash;repair to town at once&mdash;and deliver, personally,
      letters my father had enclosed to certain functionaries at the Horse
      Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promptly obeyed the order, the colonel granted my request, and Don Juan
      like, I parted with Mr. Pryme&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent30">

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I called at the quaker&rsquo;s house to say <i>adieu</i> in form,
      and found the ladies at home. I sate for a long half-hour; but had I
      remained till doomsday, I fancy Mrs. Pryme would have knitted on. At last
      I took a ceremonious leave; and&mdash;confound all stiff-backed
      gentlewomen who won&rsquo;t leave young people to themselves&mdash;Rachael and I
      parted without the kiss of peace.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ate seemed
      determined that on the world&rsquo;s stage mine should be a hurried <i>entree</i>;
      and, when I had only caught a glimpse of passing life, that my bark should
      be launched at once upon the current of existence, to float or flounder as
      it could. Short as my career had been, it had not passed unmarked by
      incident. To fortune I was already indebted for more than one deliverance;
      and believing them to be an earnest of future civilities on the lady&rsquo;s
      part, I resolved to take the world as it came, put my trust in the blind
      goddess of the wheel, and prove the proverbial good luck which mostly
      follows in the footsteps ol an Irishman. Willingly, therefore, I obeyed my
      father&rsquo;s orders, and on the following evening quitted the Emerald Isle, on
      the pleasant and profitable pursuit of &ldquo;the bubble reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had surprised me that, hitherto, no communication had reached me from
      Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole, touching the adventures which had befallen him since
      his disappearance from Kilcullen. There, his evasion, as my father
      mentioned in Iris letter, had occasioned a marvellous sensation. Miss
      Kitty O&rsquo;Dwyer, as a mere matter of course, having been expected to commit
      suicide, or die broken-hearted within a fortnight. Neither event, however,
      as the fancy say, &ldquo;came off.&rdquo; Kitty continued in rude health, and the
      fosterer&rsquo;s movements remained still wrapped in mystery. But, as it turned
      out, Mark Antony&rsquo;s career was singularly connected with my own&mdash;the
      same star appeared to rule our destinies&mdash;both were simultaneously
      leaving the land of the west, apparently at the beck of fortune&rsquo;s finger;
      and of the twain, which pursuit was the more crotchetty would have been a
      question; the fosterer, levanting for love, and I, for glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Mark Antony and his fair companion on the road, with the world
      before them, and some wayfarers, like themselves, in the rear. Whoever the
      travellers might prove to be who approached the dell where the fosterer
      and his friend had refreshed themselves, it was quite evident that the
      school where their philosophy had been acquired was of any order but the
      crying one. One manly voice trolled a jovial drinking song, to which two
      others occasionally bore a bui&rsquo;den. As a sharp turning in the road,
      skirted with thick copsewood, masked the stranger&rsquo;s advance, their merry
      laugh and reckless gaiety told that Father Care was not of &ldquo;the companie
      and their calling and character might have been shrewdly guessed from
      passing conversation and snatches of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, Pat,&rdquo; said one of the wayfarers, &ldquo;to see you in such spirits
      after parting with Nelly Blake as if your heart was breaking. Neither of
      ye cared a button at leaving me watching for a long hour at the other side
      of the hedge like a poacher, for fear the old priest would come out and
      catch you philandering with his housekeeper. Lord, how you swore, and she&mdash;poor
      girl!&mdash;believed it; but when you strove to cry and keep her company,
      oh!&mdash;that was all but the death of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tom,&rdquo; returned the second, &ldquo;if I broke down at the weeping, you
      will admit that I did not disgrace my calling, but swore like a trooper.
      You&rsquo;ll hardly believe how much that girl has bothered me. Hand me the
      cruiskeen. Remember, Tom, for love there&rsquo;s but one remedy,&mdash;and the
      beauty of it is, that for every symptom it proves a certain cure,&mdash;hear
      what the song says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;If you ere love a maid who your passion derides,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Drink enough, you&rsquo;ll find charms in a dozen besides,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Drink more, and your victory then is complete,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For you&rsquo;ll fancy you love every girl that you meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&mdash;who have we here? Talking of love, they seem to be a couple
      of Cupid&rsquo;s own. Egad, a nice girl,&mdash;and if I could but list her
      companion! Lord, what shoulders he has for a pair of wings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute the travellers were alongside the fosterer and his
      friend. A civil greeting passed; and with that easy confidence with which
      natives of the Emerald Isle hold communication with each other, it was
      speedily ascertained that the route of the united party was the same,
      until it reached a road-side inn, where the strangers announced it to be
      their intention of halting for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress and personal appearance of the wayfarers was remarkable: one
      wore the uniform of a militia-man; another the dark clothing of a student;
      but from the costume of the third, it was impossible to form any opinion
      of what his calling might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall and stout-made personage, apparently of middle age, with
      sandy hair and whiskers, partially intersprinkled with grey. His
      countenance was particularly good-humoured&mdash;and in his light blue
      eyes there was an expression of drollery and acuteness. He wore a
      hare-skin cap, a dark-coloured shooting-jacket, short tights, and leather
      gaiters. He was provided with a goat-skin knapsack&mdash;two wiry terriors
      followed closely at his heels, and a <i>dhudeene</i> and oak-stick
      completed his appointments. The style also by which his comrades addressed
      him added to the mystery of his profession: the soldier addressing him as
      &ldquo;<i>ta Copteeine</i>,&rdquo; * and the student merely calling him <i>Shemus Rhua</i>.
      **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Captain.

     ** Red James.
</pre>
    <p>
      If in the captain&rsquo;s <i>sobriquets</i> and outer man there was anything
      embarrassing, there was nothing about the soldier-like concealment. The
      chevrons on his arm told his rank, and the pack upon his shoulder his
      regiment. After announcing that he was on the route to embark with a
      draught of volunteers for the Peninsula, he thus noticed his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the student, &ldquo;is the making of a priest; but
      if I can persuade him, he&rsquo;ll not give them any trouble in Maynooth. What a
      sin it would be to spoil a fellow cut out for a flanker; and on a shoulder
      intended to carry a grenade, to hang a surplice. Leave your breviary to
      your old uncle, and take <i>brown bess</i> in place of it. Spain&rsquo;s the
      place, Tom. Egad, how the old priest will stare when he finds out that I
      have whisked away his nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; replied the student, &ldquo;the only wonder is you did not whisk away
      his niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;Ellen and I must leave matters as they are until we return.
      Then, I&rsquo;ll marry your pretty cousin, Tom, and we&rsquo;ll share Father
      Dominick&rsquo;s purse honestly between us. What say ye, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that you must put the old man under the turf first. He would not part
      with a dollar to make a colonel of ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, priests cannot live for ever. But whither are you bound, honest
      Shemus? Are you on a medical excursion at present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this gentleman a doctor?&rdquo; inquired Mark Antony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man of many trades,&rdquo; returned the sergeant, with a laugh. &ldquo;With
      Humbert he was a captain; a doctor afterwards; poaches a little now and
      then; bleeds old women; ties flies; breaks dogs; cures children; kills
      rats; and, in a word, is generally accomplished. His titles are numerous
      as his tastes; and he still holds the same rank he had when he was out
      with the French in ninety-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain smiled at the sergeant&rsquo;s description; and the travellers
      jested, laughed, and sang until they reached the public-house, where they
      were to separate from the fosterer and his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the soldier, the student, and the rat-catcher settled themselves in
      the kitchen, Mark Antony and the wandering girl retired to a private room.
      Both were heavily cast down, for in a brief space they were to part, and
      probably for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is your resolution unchangeable, Julia?&rdquo; said Mark Antony, as he
      clasped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl burst into tears, and faintly answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, Julia,&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;before you decide; and believe that
      every word that passes my lips comes directly from the heart. You say that
      you have no relations; no one to shelter and protect you; none to love
      you. Julia, why then reject me? Why should we not unite our fates and
      battle with the world as we can? Alas! I have nothing to offer you but a
      warm heart and a stout arm. I&rsquo;ll work for you&mdash;toil for you&mdash;fight
      for you. Will you not then let me love you, Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God help the worthy fosterer! With all his soul he was ready to commit
      matrimony on the moment; and without the slightest knowledge of the means
      by which he might secure a living for himself, he would have freely
      undertaken the maintenance of another still more helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; said the wanderer, for the first time calling him by that name, &ldquo;I
      value your kindness as I should; and think not, in declining to accept
      your generous offers, that I am cold to your deserving. Far from it. If
      any happiness were reserved for me, I feel that it would be in uniting my
      wrecked and wretched fortunes to yours. Nay more; had I enough for both,
      and that hereafter this blighted heart could ever love again, I would
      press you to accept my wealth and my affections; for I might safely
      conclude that with him who offered a husband&rsquo;s protection to my
      wretchedness, under altered circumstances, I could not fail in being
      happy. But no; I will not swamp your young fortunes with mine. My
      resolution is already formed&mdash;and we must part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the ardent Irishman pressed his suit upon the wanderer; but, true to
      her determination, the fosterer&rsquo;s overtures were gratefully but firmly
      rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have yet,&rdquo; she said with a sigh? &ldquo;three long long miles to travel. Oh!
      how weary will they be!&mdash;for my heart grows heavier and heavier
      still!&mdash;Ha! what mischief is abroad? Look&mdash;yonder stands that
      ruffian Jew&mdash;and see, he points his finger to this window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and what is the scoundrel?&rdquo; inquired the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; returned the girl, &ldquo;he joined a strolling party, from
      which I separated ere I met you. They are sought by outcasts like him and
      me. Another vagabond who accompanied him, in a drunken quarrel, taxed the
      Jew with being familiarized to every crime, and added, that he was a
      returned convict. What his designs regarding me were I cannot tell. When I
      left the wandering company, he followed&mdash;but, thank Heaven! you came&mdash;and
      if he meant me harm, your protection saved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the Jew had disappeared, and Mark Antony endeavoured to
      persuade his companion that this second meeting was accidental. The girl
      shook her head. Steps ascended the stairs, the door was unceremoniously
      opened, and Mr. Montague entered the room, attended by two men, who
      announced themselves to be officers of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned pale as death; while the blood rushed to Mark Antony&rsquo;s
      brows, as he stepped boldly between his companion and the strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, love!&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer. &ldquo;By heaven! I&rsquo;ll murder the
      scoundrel on the spot, if he attempts to touch you with a finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; remarked the Israelite, &ldquo;what a desperate offender he was.
      That&rsquo;s the man that robbed me of my purse, and that&rsquo;ere woman, a pal of
      his, assisted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infamous liar!&rdquo; exclaimed the accused female; while Mark Antony caught up
      the poker, and prepared for rebutting the accusation with other proofs
      than argument. The constables called for assistance; the Jew retreated
      through the door; and the sergeant, the student, and the rat-catcher
      rushed up-stairs, followed by the host of idlers who are ever found
      loitering about the precincts of an Irish inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene of indescribable confusion succeeded. All asked questions, to
      which none would vouchsafe a reply. The Jew solemnly protested he had been
      robbed; the accused indignantly repelled the charge of felony; while the
      constables insisted that all concerned should immediately repair to the
      residence of a neighbouring magistrate, there to be dealt with as
      appertained to justice. The whole party accordingly set forth to
      undergo-the ordeal of the law&rsquo;s inquiry. Mark Antony and his fair friend,
      under the especial patronage of their quondam road-companions&mdash;the
      sergeant, the student, and the rat-catcher; and the Israelite aided,
      counselled, and consoled by the village Dogberries, to whom, in the event
      of a conviction, the Jew had been, as Jews generally are, most liberal&mdash;in
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the domicile of the Justice, the <i>posse comitatus</i> halted
      in front of the hall door; for, as Mr. Blundel had just fabricated a
      fourth tumbler, and the water was of consistent heat, some time must
      elapse before the mixture could be conveniently disposed of. At last, the
      prisoners were summoned to the presence; and the accused, being duly
      arraigned, the complainant was invited to detail the wrongs he had
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his first interview with the fosterer, the Jew had endeavoured to sink
      as much of his slang as he could effect; but now his own character was to
      be supported, and his address to the seat of justice was in the peculiar
      parlance of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vy, ye see, yer vorchip, that my name is Reuben Levi. I&rsquo;m a jeweller by
      trade, and an honest man along of it. I comes to Hierland with some goods;
      sells vot I had at a loss to get home agin; and with five pound in paper,
      and three guineas and a half in goold, I was returnin to Dublin. If the
      money&rsquo;s mine, it&rsquo;s in a green silk purse, and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew paused; and a reference to Mark Antony&rsquo;s pocket confirmed the
      statement of Mr. Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, yer vorchip&mdash;ye sees I tells nothin but vots true&mdash;I was
      joggin on by a lonely road, and who overtakes me but this young voman, and
      that&rsquo;ere chap in the welveteen fie-for-shames. I twigged them, yer
      vorchip, at once; for he&rsquo;s von of the swell mob, and she no better than
      she ought to be. Vell, they fastens themselves upon me for a while, until
      I sits down upon a ditch to rest myself, and ged rid on&rsquo;em. Vell, down she
      pops upon my knee and asks me for a trifle, while her pal comes behind,
      and draws me clean as a whistle. I tries to grip my purse, but&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      a milling cove, yer vorchip&mdash;and in he pops his bunch of fives,
      darkens this here bye, and laves me flat upon my back. Off they goes like
      winky&mdash;and when I comes to myself, neither robber nor voman was to be
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The easy audacity with which the Hebrew impostor detailed the particulars
      of the alleged robbery, actually paralyzed the accused. The sergeant
      looked confounded; the student shook his head; and the rat-catcher alone
      listened with incredulity, and preserved his faith unshaken. As to the
      worthy justice, no doubt of the fosterer&rsquo;s guilt remained upon his mind;
      and all that puzzled him was, whether he could safely convict the girl as
      an accomplice. The fatal order to issue the mittimus was on his lips, when
      the Israelite addressed himself to &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s poor esquire,&rdquo; and, as it
      appeared, it was mercifully in arrest of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In speaking a few words to the worthy beak, I mean his vorchipful honour,
      I hopes the veakness of my caracter will be excused, vich vos in bein too
      tender-hearted from the werry eradel. I vould&rsquo;nt jist wish to have the
      girl clapped under the screw, nor even that&rsquo;ere chap should be lagged for
      life, though he&rsquo;s fly to everything, from thimble-riggin to wilful murder.
      So, as the blunt&rsquo;s got, if yer honour will let the voman off, and only
      shop the cove as stole the purse for the trifle of a fortnight, I&rsquo;ll not
      insist on prosecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the unblushing Jew was delivering his humane appeal, the fosterer
      grew pale with rage, the girl red with indignation. There appeared nothing
      but &ldquo;warder and fetters for the Graeme&rdquo; as the justice was in the very act
      of affixing his sign-manual to the committal, when lo! a change came over
      the scene&mdash;the sound was heard of wheels stopped suddenly&mdash;and
      next moment, a young man, in a sailor&rsquo;s dress, sprang into the room, and
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Julia, my lost one, have I found thee!&rdquo;&mdash;folded the
      wanderer in his arms, and pressed her ardently to his heart. On the girl,
      the appearance of the stranger seemed to have produced emotions of greater
      violence; she uttered a wild shriek, fainted on the sailor&rsquo;s breast, and
      was borne by her new protector in a state of insensibility from the hall
      of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this unexpected dênoûment all present appeared to be astounded. The
      fosterer was lost in astonishment, and the magistrate equally surprised to
      see a person on whom he was about to deal according to law, summarily
      removed from his jurisdiction, and by a novel proceeding, by no means so
      formal and yet very like a <i>habeas corpus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this grand <i>scena</i> was being enacted, a quieter, but not less
      interesting episode was in progress in the corner; but we must leave the
      reader in temporary suspense, as, with this occurrence, we intend to
      commence another chapter.

      CHAPTER XIV. THE TABLES TURNED&mdash;THE SAILOR&rsquo;S STORY.

      &ldquo;As thou urgest justice, be assur&rsquo;d

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>roverbs may be
      musty matters; but take them generally, and how admirably do they
      establish facts! &ldquo;Between the cup and lip&rdquo; slips are frequent and, as
      events turned out, Mr. Montague, of comic celebrity, was fated to point
      that moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been attended with more decisive success than the
      villany of the Jew. His boundless audacity had imposed upon a weak-headed
      country gentleman; and the information he had acquired at the Cock and
      Punch-bowl by listening at the wanderer&rsquo;s door, enabled him to describe
      the property, alleged to have been stolen, with an accuracy that induced
      the greater number of those who heard the charge, to believe the story of
      the robbery confirmed. The hour of revenge was come. The girl, deprived of
      her protector, and thrown loose upon the world, would once more be at his
      mercy; and the Jew&rsquo;s dark eyes brightened with fiendish delight. The man
      who had crossed his schemes, and treated him with contumely, would now be
      tenant of a prison; and the woman who had turned from him with contempt,
      and rejected his overtures with abhorrence, might soon be taught to feel
      that hatred often follows fast upon the steps of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what appeared to the Jew to be the hour of his triumph, proved
      unexpectedly, that of retribution; for to mortal villany Providence
      assigns a limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden appearance of the sailor, and the confusion it had occasioned,
      prevented the entrance of a second personage from being generally
      observed. Indeed, he slided so quietly into the room, that he seemed
      modestly endeavouring to avoid any particular attention. The stranger was
      a stout well-proportioned man, of middle height, and apparently of middle
      age; and from dress and appearance, it would have been impossible to guess
      to what order of the body politic he especially appertained. Except for a
      certain wide-awake expression of the face, he might have passed current
      for a mail-coachman, a publican, or a drover. Probably, to a horse-dealer
      he bore the closest affinity. He was dressed in a blue coat with gilt
      buttons, and extensive skirts and pockets. His vest was scarlet; his
      unmentionables drab kerseymere, to which jockey-boots were added. Round
      his neck a spotted silk handkerchief was knotted; and a white hat, with a
      remarkably broad brim, completed his costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye had been directed upon the sailor and the companion of Mark
      Antony; but lie of the scarlet vest seemed unmoved by a scene that had
      interested all besides. Indeed, he was a person on whom effect, such as
      Napoleon would term &ldquo;theatrical,&rdquo; would have been absolutely thrown away.
      His feelings were impervious even to a fainting fit; and he had no more <i>sentiment</i>
      about him than an oyster. Gliding behind the backs of the spectators, he
      reached the spot whence Mr. Montague had delivered his address to the man
      of worship, and stooping to the Jew&rsquo;s ear, whispered something which
      possessed the charm of a spell. To the very lip, colour fled from the
      sallow countenance of the Israelite. He appeared as motionless as if he
      had been mesmerized; while by a sort of sleight-of-hand the red-vested
      operator united his wrists together, quickly as if it had been done by
      magic, next moment it was discovered that Mr. Montague was manacled. The
      stranger then handed a paper to the gentleman upon the bench, with a
      request that he would &ldquo;back that warrant for the apprehension of the
      prisoner, Ikey Lazarus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of all the descendants of &ldquo;the Shallows&rdquo; Mr. Blundell looked the silliest.
      At last, however, he managed to comprehend that the Israelite was a
      returned convict, and added his signature to the order for the Jew&rsquo;s
      arrest. The court, &ldquo;in most admired disorder,&rdquo; was broken up; the runner
      retiring with his captive; the sergeant and his companions to finish a
      compotation from which they had been unexpectedly disturbed; and the
      fosterer to seek some tidings of his lost mistress, who, as he was
      informed, had been removed by the sailor in a carriage to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When consciousness returned, the poor wanderer found herself in the same
      apartment from which, not an hour since, she had been removed on a charge
      of felony. She unclosed her eyes. Was it an illusion? A look of love was
      bent upon her pallid countenance&mdash;and a long lost brother held her to
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, Julia,&rdquo; returned the sailor, with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I waking?&mdash;are you <i>alive</i>, William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, girl,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;and sound and hearty as English oak
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas said you were dead&mdash;that you had been slain in battle. How
      came you here? how have you escaped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story&rsquo;s long, my sister. I&rsquo;ll tell it to you presently. Enough; the
      squall has now blown over; and, d&mdash;&mdash;n it&mdash;we shall all be
      happy once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no&mdash;I shall never know peace of mind. Would that I could be
      forgiven!&rdquo; and tears rolled in fast succession down the poor wanderer&rsquo;s
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgiven!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor. &ldquo;For what, Julia?&mdash;For being
      swindled by the false story of a betrayer; and afterwards, with more than
      woman&rsquo;s love, clinging to the scoundrel who deceived you, until the grave
      closed upon his crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have indeed,&rdquo; said the girl, with a sigh, &ldquo;suffered for my offending.
      Oh, when I think of it, it almost maddens me! To have deserted my poor
      father, broken the old man&rsquo;s heart, and by my misconduct brought him to
      the grave.&rdquo; She paused, for sobs choked her utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t, God bless ye, break his heart,&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor. &ldquo;Had
      you run off a dozen times, he wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered it a stranded
      rope-yarn. No, no, it was other disappointments that finished uncle Josh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Finished uncle Josh?</i>&rdquo; inquired the wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; he&rsquo;s gone to Davy&rsquo;s locker, and the village has been quiet ever
      since. Three clients compromised their suits within one term; that killed
      our uncle, and Josh never raised his head afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, William&mdash;my father&mdash;my dear, dear, father&mdash;&rdquo; she
      made a pause, and then, in a suppressed voice, added, &ldquo;Is <i>he</i> not
      dead too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;He must have died since morning. I left him
      at a town ten miles off, while I came in pursuit of you, in company with a
      Bow-street officer, who was on another track, but offered to assist in
      your recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, with breathless haste, &ldquo;the death I read in
      the newspaper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that of our loving uncle. I suppose it was George Gripp that inserted
      the old boy&rsquo;s departure; for I believe the bailiff was the only being who
      regretted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall I once more, William, see my dear, dear, father?&rdquo; said the
      actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Julia, and before you sleep, the old man&rsquo;s kiss shall welcome you,
      and his blessing seal your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the hurried narrative of his sister, the warm-hearted sailor listened
      with the deepest interest. The sufferings she had undergone; the death of
      her betrayer; her deliverance from the Jew; the kindness of Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary,
      and the generous protection of the fosterer, all had their excitement, and
      elicited from William Rawlings by turns an execration or a burst of
      gratitude. No, wonder, therefore, that when Mark Antony joined the
      wanderer and her new protector, his welcome was a warm one. And yet how
      mingled in life&rsquo;s history is pain and pleasure!&mdash;how soon is
      unexpected happiness dashed with some latent regret! The prospect of an
      immediate parting alloyed the triumph of success. Neither Mark Antony nor
      the quarter-master&rsquo;s daughter felt at ease; and a similar cause of
      disquietude pressed heavily upon the breast of both. Under different
      terms, the feeling was the same; the fosterer called it by the right name&mdash;love;
      the lady by the wrong one&mdash;gratitude. Had the hearts of both been
      analysed, the chymist would have had results perfectly the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said the sailor&rsquo;s sister, &ldquo;you have not yet told me by what
      strange fortunes, one believed to be dead so long, has been again restored
      to those who love him. Oh! how vividly does that fatal evening return to
      memory, when you left your sister and your home. Alas! William, had you
      but known how desperately I was circumstanced, you would not have deprived
      me of my brother and my adviser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That unregretted relative,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;now in the grave,
      occasioned the rash act I then committed. No shadow of blame could have
      attached itself to me; for with the unfortunate homicide which occurred
      that evening I was totally unconnected. My savage uncle, who should have
      allayed my fears, alarmed me by hinting at the disgrace of incarceration;
      and, with the full conviction of innocence, I was weak enough to believe
      him. Hence, Julia, to evade an imaginary indignity, I madly left my home&mdash;and
      that at a moment, too, when my presence was most required. The adventures
      which befell me may interest you, my sister, and I shall briefly narrate
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      THE SAILOR&rsquo;S STORY
    </h3>
    <p>
      I need not tell you, Julia, that, with whatever apparent firmness I might
      have taken leave of you, to tear myself from a home, a parent, and a
      sister that I loved so fondly, was a trial which taxed my fortitude to its
      utmost extent. It is true, that I had been long weary of inaction, and
      longing after those scenes of wild excitement which war every day
      presents, and which to the ardent fancy of young minds are always so
      engrossing. Yet I hesitated to take the step; for, in my pursuit of that
      phantom, glory, how many objects of affection must be abandoned! The
      accidental embarrassment arising from the smuggling outrage of the evening
      confirmed me in a course already half resolved upon. I obeyed the impulse;
      parted from you, love; and at midnight found myself on board that gallant
      &ldquo;thing of life,&rdquo;&mdash;a British frigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her own noble class of vessels, the Harpy was among the finest; and she
      had a picked crew, and dashing commander. Cæsar O&rsquo;Brien was an Irishman of
      humble family, and yet at the early age of twenty-four, he found himself a
      post-captain. But to no underhand interest was he indebted for his rapid
      preferment. His career had been gloriously distinguished; he could look
      back upon it with honest pride, and claim every step he got on the score
      of professional deserving. Justly considered one of the ablest officers in
      the service, it was strange that upon his merits his own crew held a
      divided opinion. The younger portion declared him a man without a fault;
      the older, however, discovered a failing in his character.&mdash;&ldquo;The
      captain,&rdquo; they complained, &ldquo;<i>had too much fight in him</i>. It was true,
      he had an Irishman&rsquo;s good luck; but, in the long run, it would bring him
      into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To you, Julia, the details of sea-life would have little interest. We were
      stationed off the coast of France; and from our captain&rsquo;s daring
      character, he had been intrusted with a sort of roving commission, and
      allowed to employ the frigate almost as he pleased. During a six-months&rsquo; 
      cruise, nothing, for brilliancy or effect, could exceed the services he <i>had</i>
      rendered to his country. In every French harbour the Harpy&rsquo;s exploits were
      known and her captain&rsquo;s name associated with those of England&rsquo;s most
      daring and fortunate commanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment I entered the frigate as a volunteer, I had been fortunate
      enough to become a favourite with Captain O&rsquo;Brien. In a successful
      night-attack upon a battery and privateer, in which we dismantled the one,
      and Cut out the other, my conduct was honourably mentioned by the first
      lieutenant, and the captain&rsquo;s clerk having been killed on the occasion, I
      was promoted to fill the vacancy. In this confidential situation I
      acquitted myself with credit&mdash;and to the hour of his death, was
      treated by the warm-hearted Irishman more like an equal than an inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of our cruise had expired, and an order came for the frigate to
      return to England and refit. At sunset, the vessel sent to relieve us was
      seen in the distance; and before dark, she had exchanged numbers with the
      Harpy. In all our gallant crew not one heavy heart could have been
      discovered. After a daring and successful cruise, next morning the
      frigate&rsquo;s head would be turned to the white-cliffed island from which, for
      nine months, we had been estranged; and all, from &ldquo;the noblest captain in
      the British fleet&rdquo; to the smallest ship-boy, felt the charm which attends
      a return to fatherland, and slept to dream of &ldquo;England, home, and beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three hundred men rested that night in full security&mdash;and how-few
      were fated to see another sunset! Morning dawned&mdash;the breeze was
      light; the ocean mists rose rapidly; gradually the sea view enlarged; and
      every eye turned in that direction where the ship, arrived from England,
      might be expected to present herself. At last, a sail was announced from
      the mast-head, and the Harpy&rsquo;s course was altered towards the stranger&rsquo;s.
      In half-an-hour, the ship in sight was proclaimed by the look-out men &ldquo;a
      heavy frigate.&rdquo; The private signal was made&mdash;some minutes passed&mdash;the
      signal was unanswered&mdash;and every glass and eye were directed towards
      a ship now ascertained to be an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment orders were given to crowd canvass on the frigate. The drum
      beat to quarters; the sails were accurately trimmed; and, as if she had
      determined to sustain her well-earned reputation to the last, the Harpy
      dashed through the water gallantly&mdash;and for every two knots the chase
      sailed, we went three.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the frigate was under a cloud of sail, Captain O&rsquo;Brien retired to his
      cabin to dress, leaving orders that the progress of the chase, from time
      to time, should be reported. As he passed me, he touched my arm and
      whispered me to follow him. I did so. The captain desired his servant to
      retire, put on his uniform, affixed a foreign order to his breast, and,
      having unlocked a drawer, he took from it a sealed packet, and thus
      addressed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rawlings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the hour you entered this frigate, I have
      remarked your character and conduct. From the high opinion I formed of
      both, I selected you to fill a place of trust, and I am now about to give
      you what may be a last proof of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the founder of my own fortune. My father was an humble curate, not
      &lsquo;passing rich on forty pounds a year,&rsquo; but poor as a church-mouse, and my
      mother the daughter of a farmer. I was born in one of the remotest
      villages on the western coast of Ireland; and, except the advantages of
      education&mdash;the only boon my poor father could bestow&mdash;I had
      nothing to distinguish me in boyhood from the sons of the fishermen who
      inhabited our secluded hamlet. Like them, the sea was the element I loved;
      and, but for an accident, like them also, I should have lived and died
      upon that element unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evening, when I was about twelve years old, a message came from the
      only publie-house the village boasted, to say that a sick stranger had
      arrived and was most anxious to see a clergyman. The summons was obeyed;
      and my father was introduced to an elderly man, who seemed to be
      dangerously ill, and greatly exhausted by his journey. He announced
      himself a lieutenant of a man-of-war; he had been for several years on the
      West-India station; was now on leave of absence for bad health; and was
      endeavouring to reach a town at a considerable distance from our hamlet,
      to try whether native air might not yet effect a cure. The exertion,
      however, had been too much for him; and on arriving at the public-house,
      he found himself unable to proceed farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parson was a kind-hearted being, and as hospitable as he was poor.
      The ale-house was noisy and uncomfortable, and he therefore pressed the
      stranger to take up his residence at our cottage, where, with quiet and
      care, it was probable that he might speedily come round again. My father&rsquo;s
      invitation was accepted; and in a few days the invalid was so far restored
      as to be enabled to resume his journey. He took his leave accordingly,
      gratefully acknowledging the kindness and attention of my parents, to
      which he attributed his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year passed&mdash;the stranger was forgotten; and our lonely villagers
      had no events to excite them beyond every-day occupations. They were
      removed from the cares and anxieties of busier life; but, as events
      proved, they were not secure from its common calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Typhus fever broke out in a neighbouring sea-port; the crew of a
      fishing-boat caught the infection, and introduced the terrible disease
      into our crowded hamlet. Numbers became its victims; and in the same week
      both my parents died, and I was left upon the world without any natural
      protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the evening of my father&rsquo;s funeral I was sent for to the public-house,
      and there, to my surprise, I found the stranger who had been my father&rsquo;s
      guest a year before. The sick lieutenant had been restored to health, and
      was about to resume his professional duties. He had been appointed to a
      ship; but before he left the kingdom, he made our village his line of
      route, that he might have an opportunity of thanking my parents once more
      for past kindnesses. He found those who succoured him in the grave,&mdash;their
      only child an orphan, and without a relative who could afford him
      protection or a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tear trickled down the cheek of the rough old sailor, as he listened to
      the story of my destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And has he no friends, poor boy?&rsquo; inquired the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;None,&rsquo; said the landlord, in reply. &lsquo;I believe he has not one relative
      who could give him a second meal, nor a friend who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;False, by Heaven!&rsquo; exclaimed the tar. &lsquo;He has a friend who will divide
      his last guinea with him; and from this hour, I am the orphan&rsquo;s father!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be brief. Lieutenant Oakley stopped that evening in the village,
      and when he left it next morning I was his companion. He was a rough, but
      warm-hearted sailor of the old school; and, after a year&rsquo;s probation, he
      succeeded in having me rated on the books of a line-of-battle ship as
      midshipman. A few months afterwards, my protector was killed in a boat
      affair upon the coast of Spain&mdash;once more I was left upon the world&mdash;and
      at fifteen years of age I had to fight with fortune as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rawlings, you know now the story of my early life. Without a being to
      guide my boyhood, I was flung on the wide ocean of existence. The sword
      has been my talisman, and I have hewn my own road to fame. My very
      destitution placed me in fortune&rsquo;s track. I had no gentle ties to bind me
      to the world: if I died, none would shed a tear: what, then, was life to
      me?&mdash;A nothing! I staked it with a gambler&rsquo;s recklessness, and I have
      earned for myself the name that birth denied me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A noise on deck was heard. &ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will return
      immediately.&rdquo; After a few minutes, Captain O&rsquo;Brien re-entered the cabin,
      his face beaming with delight, and its expression betokening the
      confidence of anticipated victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Harpy goes nobly through it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Blow, sweet breeze! blow
      for another hour steadily&mdash;bring me alongside that splendid frigate&mdash;and
      then, Dame Fortune! thy spoiled child shall tax thee no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused; took two or three turns across the cabin, and then resumed the
      strain of former conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time presses&mdash;and now, Rawlings, for another disclosure. Three years
      ago I returned to England,&mdash;&lsquo;The happy deed that gilds my humble name
      was done&mdash;I obtained promotion for the service&mdash;and wherever I
      appeared, flattering tokens of popular approbation were heaped on me with
      unmeasured liberality. Men cheered me as I passed, and&mdash;prouder
      honour&mdash;woman smiled upon the daring sailor. To the highest circles
      the curate&rsquo;s son was introduced: my passport, <i>à coup de sabre</i>,
      which finished a French captain, and enabled me to lay hands on the
      halliards of a frigate&rsquo;s ensign, before those of fifty stout boarders as
      myself. I met a woman: she was older than myself a year or two; noble by
      birth; and for beauty, if you sought England over&mdash;and that is
      beauty&rsquo;s home&mdash;you could not find her peer. She was followed and
      worshipped: the proudest claimed her smiles, and the noblest coronet was
      offered for her acceptance. Chance introduced me to her father; and I was
      a casual visitor at his house, with men distinguished for both high birth
      and unbounded wealth. Would it be credited that I was preferred by that
      proud lady to all who sought her hand? I&mdash;the ocean child&mdash;before
      a crowd of nobles&mdash;the humble sailor loved by the <i>fiancée</i> of a
      duke! &rsquo;Tis over;&mdash;she is another&rsquo;s now: and with the heart that fate
      forbade being united to mine, the mutual secret rests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know enough to understand the service I require. If in the
      approaching conflict my brief career shall close, the story of my love
      must perish with me. In this sealed packet there are memorials, that,
      living, I could not part with, and, in death, must be destroyed. It is
      leaded&mdash;and should I fall, consign it to the same element where I
      shall find a grave. Farewell! I feel a strange assurance, that with this
      day&rsquo;s events, whatever they may prove, my history is doomed to terminate.
      No matter! Where could it close more gloriously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, and quitted the cabin for the deck; and when I had secured the
      sealed packet in my breast, I followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chase had now assumed an interest almost impossible to be imagined.
      Both frigates, in the parlance of the sea, were &ldquo;staggering under a press
      of canvass;&rdquo; and the goal for which each vessel strained was a small
      harbour, with a narrow entrance through the centre of a reef of rocks.
      There, the Frenchman expected to find his safety&mdash;and we endeavoured
      to cut him off from this his haven of inglorious refuge. We were still two
      gun-shots astern&mdash;the harbour not a league off&mdash;the wind began
      to fail&mdash;and as the Harpy sailed best with a stiff breeze, we lost
      the advantage we had formerly possessed in speed. Indeed, the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      escape seemed almost certain. He must gain the anchorage before we could
      bring him to close action; and, daring as our captain was, surely he would
      not venture into a roadstead on every side surrounded with heavy
      batteries, and approachable through a narrow opening in a reef of rocks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Fortune may be tried too frequently&mdash;and even her chosen
      favourites will prove her at times capricious. Again, the breeze
      freshened, and the Harpy drew fast a-head. The vessels were now within
      cannon range&mdash;the chase-guns of both had opened&mdash;and at the
      third discharge from ours, the main-top-mast of the Frenchman came down.
      It is probable that fatal success induced our captain to take the step he
      did. Instead of bringing his frigate to the wind, he held his course, and
      desperately ran into a hostile harbour from which it was decreed we never
      should return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this rash act was brilliant as it proved disastrous. After a
      close engagement of forty minutes, the enemy&rsquo;s frigate was totally
      dismasted, and driven&mdash;a wreck&mdash;upon the rocks; and Captain
      O&rsquo;Brien having completed her destruction, endeavoured to work the Harpy
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time we suffered but trifling injury from the cross-fire of the
      batteries, and it was almost certain that we should weather the tail of
      the reef, and clear the entrance of the harbour. The frigate was in stays.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do it easily,&rdquo; exclaimed the master; while Captain O&rsquo;Brien, with a
      smile of exultation, whispered in my ear, &ldquo;What think you, Rawlings, of
      the fortunes of the curate&rsquo;s son? Hold on the packet&mdash;my star has
      saved us!&rdquo; Alas! his exultation was but short-lived. A thirty-two-pound
      shot struck us as he spoke: the foretop-mast went over the side&mdash;we
      missed stays, fell off to leeward, and settled on the reef, within
      musket-range of the heaviest battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seas struck the vessel so fast and heavily that it was quite apparent
      she would speedily go to pieces. The captain fell mortally wounded. He
      turned a dying look to me: I understood its silent order; and the packet
      which contained the memorials of his secret love was committed to the
      deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes afterwards the fate of all on board the Harpy was
      decided. A lofty swell came rolling in&mdash;the disabled frigate was
      lifted off the reef&mdash;she fell over into deep water, settled, and went
      down; and in her shattered hull, the dead, the dying, and the living found
      a common grave; for, with the exception of myself and six others, not
      another soul of that gallant crew escaped. &lsquo;We saved ourselves on floating
      portions of the wreck, to be picked up the same evening, and made
      prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      What calamitous events had one brief day produced! On the preceding
      evening, how happily had I sought my hammock, home in my fancy, and you,
      Julia, in my dreams! How was all changed! frigate and crew buried together
      in the ocean deeps, and in the very moment of their triumph!&mdash;and the
      poor handful that survived, consigned to a captivity so hopeless, that to
      its duration no limit could be assigned!
    </p>
    <p>
      We were marched into the interior, and secured in an old fortress, already
      over-crowded with squalid creatures, half-clad, half-starved, and to whom,
      generally, death would have been a deliverance&mdash;the only one, indeed,
      that they, poor wretches, could look to with any thing like certainty. At
      first, I thought I should have sunk into despair; but it is strange how
      soon men will accommodate themselves to misery. Gradually the cup of
      suffering lost a portion of its bitterness; and in the laugh, at first
      torturous to my ears, at last <i>I</i> could also join. &ldquo;Let none despond,
      let none despair&rdquo;&mdash;there is no mortal evil without its remedy. Before
      a month passed, the elasticity of my spirit returned&mdash;another current
      of thought occupied my mind&mdash;my very dreams were engrossed with
      projects of escape&mdash;and every bird that flitted across the prison
      walls seemed to invite me to become as free as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor was a soldier of the republic, wounded and worn out, and for
      past services entrusted with the custody of the prisoners of war collected
      in the fortress. He was a strict disciplinarian; stern in enforcing
      obedience to the regulations of the place, but kind at heart, and easily
      conciliated. After my first despondency had abated, I endeavoured to
      resign myself to my fate; and by conforming to the rules which Captain St.
      Simon had laid down for due maintenance of order, I became rather a
      favourite with the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could question the bravery of Captain St. Simon; for, among other
      daring acts he had performed, he had married a woman thirty years younger
      than himself. The lady was very pretty, very gay, loved fêtes and dancing,
      and detested the dulness of the fortress. One child had blessed the
      marriage-bed of the commandant: she was a sweet girl of three years; and
      in her the affections of both parents seemed to centre. Indeed, they
      idolized the child; and none could know little Claudine and not love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To children I have been ever partial; and with the governor&rsquo;s I soon
      became a favourite. I never passed Claudine without a kiss. My attentions
      gratified the parents. Madame rewarded them with a smile, and the old
      republican, with long narratives of all that he had done at Lodi and
      Marengo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the unfortunates within the place, the effects of captivity were
      variously exhibited. Some bore confinement with apparent indifference,
      while others evinced a sullen despondency. One man struck me as being more
      miserable than any in the fortress besides; and the fixed melancholy
      visible in his air and countenance induced me to inquire who he was, and
      ask the cause of his being more wretched than the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Aylmer, and he was a captain of dragoons. In returning from
      the Peninsula, the merchantman in which he came home a passenger had been
      taken by a privateer; and, to render that accident the more distressing,
      the errand that brought him to England was to marry a beautiful girl, to
      whom for years he had been passionately attached. Hitherto, pecuniary
      considerations forbade the union; but by the death of a wealthy relative
      that obstacle was removed. What must have been his disappointment, when,
      almost in sight of the home of her he loved so ardently, fate marred his
      promised happiness, and dashed from the very lip the cup of bliss!
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, then, that Aylmer bore this visitation with impatience. Months
      wore away; interest had been used to accomplish an exchange; and now a
      hope was held out that this much desired event would be speedily effected.
      Once more the captive smiled; the colour returned to his faded cheek, and
      his brow was no longer contracted. Alas for woman&rsquo;s faith! News came from
      England, that she whom he all but idolized had forgotten the being who
      loved so truly,&mdash;and&mdash;that she was married to another!
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Aylmer never smiled. His heart was seared; his hopes of
      happiness were withered. He became a gloomy misanthrope; prowled through
      the dark passages of the prison by himself; rejected every overture at
      intimacy; and that which had once been a gentle heart, seemed to lose all
      sympathy with the human race, and become to all its species wolfish and
      immitigable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood at one angle of the fortress an ancient tower of immense
      height, which, for many miles, overlooked the surrounding country. By a
      winding staircase the top of the building could be gained; the roof was
      fiat, and encircled by a parapet not quite breast-high; and, as the view
      from the summit was varied and extensive, prisoners, who would go through
      the labour of ascending seven flights of granite stairs, amused a portion
      of monotonous captivity by gazing in listless idleness on scenes of busy
      life, which, to their state of thrall, presented a sad and sickening
      contrast. This tower was a favourite retreat of Captain Aylmer&mdash;and
      over the parapet of the roof he would lean alone for hours, muttering
      gloomily to himself, or communing with sad thoughts in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, when Claudine was in my arms, I observed, that in passing us, the
      expression of Aylmer&rsquo;s eyes was absolutely malignant; and I marvelled that
      a face so innocently beautiful as that of the child of the commandant, did
      not, like David&rsquo;s harp, exert a gentle influence, and speak peace to the
      dark spirit of the captive. It was strange also, that, by some curious
      impulse, Claudine involuntarily recoiled from this melancholy man, and
      that while he continued in sight, she would cling closely to my bosom as
      if there she was seeking for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of a sultry day, and the hour was come when, by prison
      regulations, the <i>détenus</i> were expected to repair to their
      respective wards, and there be locked up for the night. On my way to the
      gallery where I slept, I had to cross an esplanade in front of the
      governor&rsquo;s house. Claudine noticed me from the window, and ran out to say
      &ldquo;good night.&rdquo; I carried her a few paces in my arms, kissed the pretty
      child, set her down, and received from the fond mother a gracious nod of
      approbation. The drum ruffled, it was the signal for the prisoners to fall
      in for roll-call, and I hurried on. Suddenly a piercing shriek arrested
      me. I turned round; Madame St. Simon had uttered it, and one movement of
      her arm told the cause. Aylmer was running madly across the esplanade in
      the direction of the old tower, with Claudine struggling in his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dashed after him at headlong speed. He sprang into the building and
      bounded up the stairs&mdash;Claudine&rsquo;s wild screams continued&mdash;and I
      heard her calling &ldquo;William!&rdquo; Although Aylmer had cleared one flight of
      steps before I entered, I overtook him as he jumped with his intended
      victim on the roof; seized him with one arm, and twisting my hand into his
      collar, half strangled him, and forced him to drop the child. Upon me the
      full fury of his rage was turned, and a deadly struggle commenced. In
      height and weight we were equally matched; but his maniac strength was
      superhuman. After a desperate conflict of a minute, both came heavily to
      the ground locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, the madman uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn, he attempted to choke me, and I as desperately resisted.
      Apparently, the phrenzy of his rage rendered him insensible to pain; for
      though I caught his hand within my teeth until they met, the maniac would
      not let go his murderous hold. My strength failed, I found myself
      fainting, another minute and his triumph would have been complete, but
      fortunately, an alarm had been given that brought assistance, and three of
      the gendarmes who formed the prison guard, rushed on the tower roof with
      drawn swords, tore Aylmer away, and endeavoured to secure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a marvellous effort the madman shook his assailants off, and answered
      their order to surrender with a laugh of wild derision&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
       he shouted, &ldquo;you fancy that Aylmer will be a prisoner. Tell your
      commander, that if that sailor fellow had not marred my scheme of
      vengeance, his fair girl would have been what in another moment I shall be&mdash;a
      shattered mass of lifeless flesh&mdash;and now for the leap of liberty!
      Ha, ha!&rdquo; he roared out convulsively, and, with a demon&rsquo;s laugh, before any
      could lay hands upon him, the maniac vaulted across the platform of the
      tower, and we heard, some twenty seconds afterwards, the dull sound his
      lifeless body made as it fell on the paved court below.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had received some severe bruises in the deadly struggle with, the
      unfortunate madman; and my throat and neck were blackened by the pressure
      of his knuckles. The gendarmes supported me to the governor&rsquo;s house, wine
      was given me, and the surgeons of the fortress were called in. From
      Madame, I received abundantly the ardent tokens of a woman&rsquo;s gratitude in
      tears and kisses, while the old republican, her husband, held my hand in
      his, and, with the speechless eloquence of the eye, thanked me in the
      silence of a heart too full to give utterance to its feelings, for saving
      the treasure of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder then, that with me the rigour of imprisonment was abated, and
      that I was now a captive but in name. At the governor&rsquo;s table a cover was
      laid for me, the old man treating me as he would have done a son; and
      Nina, as his wife was named, regarding me as a brother. Of course I felt
      the kindness evinced by both; and I might have been supposed to be the
      happiest captive in the fortress. Yet the yearning after home continued;
      and many a sigh told Nina and her husband, that notwithstanding their
      efforts to remove it, &ldquo;a sickening void was aching in the breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said the old republican, as he passed the wine-flask over, &ldquo;Why
      have you been so dispirited of late? Is it within my power to make you
      happier? Have you any thing to ask for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina&rsquo;s eyes filled&mdash;&ldquo;Speak, William! speak without reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A blackbird was hanging in his cage beside the open casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would that captive ask for,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;could he but make known his
      wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said the governor; &ldquo;and what you sigh after is almost
      the only boon beyond my power of granting. For liberty, the appeal must be
      made to the highest individual in the empire, and let me at once apprise
      you, that <i>there</i> you would find the ear of mercy closed. You seem
      astonished&mdash;listen, and wonder then will cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our prison regulations are framed, in some degree, according to the
      system of our general police; and the character and career of those
      committed to my charge are carefully recorded. To the safe custody of
      those who have been daring and successful, my attention is especially
      directed; and while with a nameless man an exchange is effected without
      much difficulty, he, who if free, might prove a troublesome enemy, is
      rarely restored to liberty. Your frigate was the terror of our coast. Your
      captain bore a reputation second to none among the most daring and
      dangerous of your naval adventurers. You are noted in our prison record as
      having won your leader&rsquo;s favour, by assisting in some bold exploit that I
      do not recollect at present. Believe me, my dear boy, it would be hopeless
      to expect that you, and spirits like yourself, would be allowed an
      opportunity of harassing the coast of France a second time. I go to make
      my prison returns to-morrow. Would that I might venture the experiment of
      getting your name included in the next cartel with any prospect of
      success! Oh! no, no, it were idle&mdash;it were hopeless altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night when I retired to my cot, I felt the sad conviction that
      nothing but escape could ever effect my deliverance from the gloomy
      fortress, in which, it would appear that for life I was fated to remain
      immured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning passed in the dull monotony of confinement. I supped with
      Nina and her child. The commander was to be absent for two days, and when
      Claudine retired to bed, Madame St. Simon and I were left together.
      Latterly I had observed a change in Nina&rsquo;s manner. There was not the same
      freedom that formerly had marked our intercourse, and while kinder than
      ever, I fancied that her gaiety was assumed, and her spirits forced and
      unnatural. Since the evening of poor Aylmer&rsquo;s suicide, I had been
      transferred to a small chamber attached to the governor&rsquo;s dwelling, was
      exempted from attending roll-call, and left consequently with unrestrained
      liberty, to wander through the prison where I pleased. It struck eleven,
      the fortress was quiet, the guard set, and I rose, to leave Nina, and
      repair to my own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;my sister;&rdquo; for by that name I had been permitted
      to address the lady of the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop&mdash;William,&rdquo; she replied, in evident embarrassment, &ldquo;I wish to
      talk with you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sate down again beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have remarked how ardently you are longing after freedom. St. Simon
      cannot honourably effect it; and a soldier&rsquo;s honour, William, should be
      dearer far to him than life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you feel the sentiment, and I am convinced that it guides your
      acts, my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Nina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And surely it should guide <i>mine</i>&mdash;a soldier&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a
      soldier&rsquo;s orphan. I never told you my short history, William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear Nina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the daughter of a sous-lieutenant, who was killed in the Low
      Countries while I was yet a baby. Dying, he committed me to a comrade&rsquo;s
      care; and faithfully that comrade discharged what he considered a sacred
      duty. I was tenderly nursed when young, and when I was old enough, placed
      as a boarder in a convent. At fifteen, my benefactor&rsquo;s sister, with whom I
      had resided for the two preceding years, died suddenly. I was thus left,
      to a certain extent, without protection; and Captain St. Simon offered me
      the only one a man can give&mdash;the sacred one of husband. In our
      marriage, love could not have had aught to do. He was fifty; I, fifteen.
      He, for honourable motives had offered to make me his, and I, through
      gratitude, consented. Five years have passed. All the happiness which
      could be expected from a union so unequal in point of years, has been
      mine. If I said I were happy as a wife, I should say what was untrue. But
      am I not the consort of a brave old man, the mother of a child, in whom
      all my love is centered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with these objects of affection, Nina, you must be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; she answered, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Was?</i> Nina. Nay, nay, <i>you are</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, William; strong in gratitude to my husband. I feel a woman&rsquo;s weakness
      in the heart, and love and duty by turns obtain its mastery. William,
      neither you nor I have yet seen two-and-twenty summers; and at that age,
      friendship is too close akin to love to be encouraged. My husband dare not
      assist you to escape&mdash;<i>I dare, and will</i>. Prudence tells us to
      separate; and the act that would sully the honest reputation of the old
      soldier, is not dishonourable in his wife. Yes&mdash;it shall be done. I
      have already devised means for your deliverance, and when my plan is fully
      matured, you shall know all. Farewell. Let us not meet in future but in my
      husband&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo; She stooped her cheek to me, I kissed it, next moment
      she quitted the supper-room, and I returned to my chamber, to marvel how
      much strength and weakness, principle and passion, can be united in a
      woman&rsquo;s heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day the governor returned. I, as usual, took my place at the
      dinner-table, and Nina met me with smiles. She seemed perfectly at ease,
      I, also, exerted myself to be cheerful, and none would have suspected that
      secret love was lurking in the bosoms of us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would that you had witnessed the review,&rdquo; said the old soldier. &ldquo;It
      was, indeed, a splendid spectacle. And the Emperor looked so delighted as
      the troops filed past! Well he might, a nobler or more perfect <i>corps
      d&rsquo;armée</i> never was collected. Egad, the sight warmed this old blood
      again; and I think there&rsquo;s stuff in me for another campaign. Will you,
      William, take charge of Madame and Claudine?&rdquo; said the commandant,
      laughingly. I made some indifferent reply&mdash;Nina&rsquo;s eye met mine&mdash;it
      seemed to say, the charge would have been a dangerous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the inner gate of the fortress open, a horse&rsquo;s feet clattered
      along the pavement, and, in a short time, a <i>chasseur à cheval</i>
      presented himself, and delivered a despatch to the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the seal was broken the old man&rsquo;s eye turned to me. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;an answer to the memorial I handed to the Emperor yesterday. I
      petitioned for your liberty, William; and stated, in as warm language as I
      could, the grounds on which I asked the favour. I know, even from the
      promptness of the reply, that my application has been rejected. Well, it
      is only what I was prepared for. Let us read the terms of the refusal.
      lia! I know the handwriting; it is that of my old comrade, Duroc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am desired, by his Majesty the Emperor, to acknowledge the receipt of
      a petition from Captain St. Simon. Its prayer, that the English sailor,
      William Rawlings, shall be set at liberty, is hereby peremptorily
      rejected.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said the commandant with a sigh, as he let the paper fall
      upon the floor. A deep and painful silence succeeded, while Claudine
      picked the letter up and handed it to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, Nina&mdash;we know the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady complied, taking up the perusal of the document at the point
      where her husband had stopped. &ldquo;&lsquo;But from the moment this order comes to
      hand, give the gallant Englishman the enclosed bill, and let the preserver
      of the soldier&rsquo;s child receive freedom from the hand of her father.&rsquo; See!
      the initial of the great Napoleon is annexed,&mdash;and a note for five
      hundred francs! You are free, William.&rsquo; May Heaven&rsquo;s blessings light upon
      our gracious Emperor!&rdquo; And Nina flung herself upon my breast. She wept&mdash;were
      her tears those of love or joy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be brief, Julia. By the first cartel, I came back to England&mdash;repaired
      to our native village&mdash;heard, for the first time, the sad tidings of
      your elopement&mdash;found my father living&mdash;my uncle dead&mdash;and
      learned that, for many months, the poor quarter-master had been in
      mourning for his son. To the broken-hearted old man the news was
      cautiously communicated that he was not so desolate as he believed
      himself. One child was restored to him as from the dead, and tidings were
      heard of the wanderer. Instantly, we set out to seek the lost one, and,
      thank Heaven! our search has not been vain. Yes, Julia, our once happy
      cottage shall again be the home of peace; and ere the sun sets, a father&rsquo;s
      blessing shall seal the pardon of his returning child. And now, before we
      commence our journey, I have to compensate the officer for his trouble;
      and, indeed, without his assistance, I should have scarcely found you out.
      Was it not a strange fatality, that objects so different as those that
      brought the runner and myself from England, should have led us to the same
      point?&rdquo; He said, and left the room. What occurred then and there between
      the fosterer and fair fugitive, may be readily imagined. Their troth was
      mutually interchanged; and, &ldquo;resolved in future to do right,&rdquo; subject to a
      father&rsquo;s approbation, the lady consented at the expiration of a year to
      commit matrimony a second time, and share the fortunes of Mark Antony
      O&rsquo;Toole.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the travellers branched off by the roads which intersected each other
      in front of the little hostelrie, their appearance, and the objects of
      their present pursuits, might be taken as a <i>tableau vivant</i> of what
      life is&mdash;of what man aims at. By one road, the sailor and his sister
      were hastening to restore comfort to an afflicted heart&mdash;by another,
      the Jew, in charge of the officer of justice, was being conveyed to that
      home of felony&mdash;a jail. The third road tended to scenes of glory; and
      thither the soldier was hastening after seducing the student to quit the
      cloister for the field. The fourth route the fosterer took at chance, and
      reckless whither it might lead to, there Mark Antony determined to
      recommence his wanderings; and &ldquo;the captain&rdquo; having discovered that there
      was another who, for a time at least, was bent on taking the world as it
      came, at once proposed to form a travelling co-partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may find out hereafter, that had Mark Antony declined the offer
      of the rat-catcher, he might have pointed a moral, by &ldquo;going further and
      faring worse.&rdquo; Indeed, it would have been well for me had I the good luck
      of falling into as honest company, and short as the succeeding chapter is,
      I think it will establish that fact.

      CHAPTER XV. LIFE IN LONDON.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n one of those
      half-forgotten modes of transport, a sailing packet, denominated the
      Eclipse, I departed from the Pigeon House, and with a fair and steady
      breeze landed at Holyhead, after a short passage of nine hours. In those
      days this feat was accounted respectable; for in their transits from the
      emerald isle to the land of shopkeepers, it was no uncommon circumstance
      for ill-starred gentlemen to pass so many days and nights at sea, as to
      induce a belief that, in mistake, they had booked themselves in the Flying
      Dutchman, and consequently, had the pleasing prospect of sailing to
      eternity. I was still further fortunate in securing a seat in the London
      mail. In due time I reached the modern Babylon, transferred my person and
      effects from the White Horse Cellar to a Bond-street hotel, and there, for
      a limited period, established my household gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this memorable epoch of my history, my first visit to the great
      metropolis, life in London was very different to what it is at present.
      Theatres were frequented by the upper classes, and Vauxhall was in all its
      glory. An English singer was then listened to; it was not considered
      disreputable to keep a native servant; and without loss of caste, a lady
      might submit her head to the curling irons of an <i>artiste</i>, who had
      been actually born and indoctrinated within sound of Bow bell. The clubs
      were few and exclusive. People resided in lodgings and hotels adapted to
      their ranks and pockets; in their mode of life a gentlemanly consistency
      was maintained: and a man who in noontide was the occupant of an edifice,
      erected with the costly expense formerly bestowed upon a palace, would
      not, on an alarm of fire at midnight, have been unkennelled from the back
      attic of a stay-maker, tenanted for the moderate consideration of three
      shillings and sixpence, &ldquo;paid weekly and in advance.&rdquo; Indeed, a sort of
      John Bullish principle pervaded society at large. If men staked large sums
      on questionable events, it was generally expected that they would pay,
      should their speculations prove unfortunate. The guards were frequently
      relieved to music not Rossini&rsquo;s. Tailors who had never seen the Palais
      Royale, received instructions in bookkeeping from divers of the nobility;
      and a bootmaker&mdash;tell it not in Gath&mdash;was considered absolutely
      fashionable, albeit the unhappy man was afflicted with the desperate
      patronymic of O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, at this period of English history, when young and old France were
      about to retire before Lord Wellington, the tone of society was
      anti-continental. The aristocracy conversed in their native tongue; meats,
      as Heaven sent them, might be seen frequently at the table of a peer; and
      there was a vulgar prejudice against being poisoned, even though the <i>artiste</i>
      were warranted true <i>Parisien</i>. Saltations, happily unremembered, but
      bearing as it is believed, a distant affinity to the vulgar affair now
      termed <i>contre-danse</i>, were extensively perpetrated; and persons
      engaged in the same, instead of being elegantly paralytic, moved as if
      their limbs were controllable. Then, the refinement of the <i>valse</i>
      was undiscovered; and if a <i>cavalier</i> ventured to clasp a lady in his
      arms&mdash;Lombard-street to a China orange!&mdash;he would have been
      kicked by husband, father, or brother, out of the room incontinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assisted by my father&rsquo;s letter, the great object of my journey was happily
      accomplished. Within three weeks the exchange I sought for was effected;
      and I was in due form gazetted to a lieutenancy in an old regiment
      cantoned for the winter on the Agueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time I visited the capital, the position a stranger held in society
      was generally estimated by the quarter he inhabited; and before I started
      from Dublin, I took counsel touching &ldquo;the whereabouts&rdquo; of a suitable
      abode. Mr. Pryme recommended some place with a &ldquo;man&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; in a lane
      near Crutched Friars; while Captain Forester, a castle aid-de-camp,
      denounced the same, declaring it to be only a place fit for a bagman, and
      recommended Long&rsquo;s or Stevens&rsquo;s. Well! it was seventeen years since Mr.
      Pryme had been in town, and probably Crutched Friars was not as
      fashionable now as it might have been formerly. Captain Forester infested
      London every season, and consequently Captain Forester must be right. To
      Bond-street accordingly I drove. Alas, how blindly people speculate upon
      events! Had I driven to the &ldquo;man&rsquo;s head&rdquo; in Crutched Friars, I should have
      been safer by a hundred&mdash;&ldquo;and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intervals between my visits to the Horse Guards were occupied in
      exploring the capital from Tyburn Turnpike to Tower Hill; and by singular
      good fortune, I formed an acquaintance with a gentleman to whom London and
      all its wonders were familiar. He kindly undertook to play bear-leader for
      the nonce and under the guidance of Colonel Santonier, I traversed &ldquo;the
      mighty mass of brick, and stone, and mortar,&rdquo; even from Dan to Beersheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was an emigrant who, for political opinions, had been exiled
      from &ldquo;la belle France.&rdquo; He was a royalist connected with half the nobility
      of the ancient regime, his address was good, his disposition plastic and
      companionable. He had seen the world extensively, and therefore was the
      better qualified to introduce a neophyte like me upon the stage of life.
      On quitting his native country he had been accompanied by his sister. She
      was young, pretty, and accomplished; and, as the Colonel declared, &ldquo;the
      most artless being in the world.&rdquo; I never saw relatives more attached.
      They never met or parted without a kiss; and yet, one thing struck me as
      remarkable, there was not the slightest family likeness between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it surprising that an acquaintance so valuable and agreeable, ripened
      into a friendship of such ardour that Damon and Pythias might have been
      jealous? Most of my time was spent in the society of the Colonel and his
      fair sister; and as I had jobbed a buggy, sometimes I drove my friend
      about town, or exhibited Mademoiselle Adelaide in Rotten Row. Santonier
      had few acquaintances, and when I had Madame by my side, I often remarked
      that very impudent looks were directed towards the lady. Once, too, when
      we were brought to a dead halt by the break-down of a coal-waggon, I heard
      a fashionable scoundrel observe to his companion as they passed&mdash;&ldquo;Lord,
      Frank, what a flat that spoon is!&rdquo; <i>Flat!&mdash;spoon!</i> Hang it,&mdash;neither
      term surely could apply to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I think, had it lasted only another week, our friendship would have been
      registered in heaven. We dined here and there, made short excursions out
      of town, our amicable arrangements were perfect&mdash;for Monsieur
      Santonier placed such implicit confidence in my honour and discretion,
      that Adelaide was considered in perfect security when with me. She, sweet
      girl, was so inartificial that she even owned she felt herself <i>minus</i>
      a heart,&mdash;and had I been consigned to the gallows, I verily believe
      the Colonel would have borne me company, and requested to be accommodated
      with another rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably a delicate sensitiveness respecting Adelaide, which made
      Santonier so very particular as to those who should be admitted to his
      house. With one exception, I was an exclusive visitor; for in
      Jermyn-street I never met any person but a nice old gentleman with green
      spectacles and a bald head, called the Baron Francheti; and every night he
      added himself to the party. We had coffee, played cards, and Adelaide was
      my partner, although, sweet girl, I was literally her ruin. I held bad
      hands, introduced spades when I should lead diamonds, of course we always
      lost, Adelaide never murmured, but handed the money to the Baron without a
      reflection on my unskilful play. What could I do? Nothing but present an
      indemnity in the morning; and she graciously approved the taste of my
      selection, and condescended to accept the offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day I was gazetted, in company with some other aspirants for
      military glory, we dined together to celebrate our promotion, and, as
      became soldiers of promise, got drunk afterwards. Some managed to reach
      their hotels, some stopped short in divers watch-houses; while I, under
      the guidance of the star of love, headed my course instinctively to my
      lady&rsquo;s bower in Jermyn-street. As usual, the family party were at home. We
      played; for I remember something about overturning a lamp upon the card
      cloth. In a short time I dropped off the chair, was trundled home in a
      coach, put to bed, and remained in deep repose, until daylight and a
      thundering head-ache brought their pleasant reminiscences. I looked to the
      table: no property was there, except a couple of shillings and an empty
      note-case. Before I had gone to dinner, I changed my last fifty, and
      stocked my pocket-book with the produce. A pleasant position! Out of two
      hundred pounds advanced me by the Quaker, not a sous left, and the hotel
      bill and half my appointments still unpaid!
    </p>
    <p>
      I never had known a pecuniary difficulty before. What was to be done? In
      London, and without a guinea! Should I write to my father, and tell him
      that before I had been three months upon the world, I had despised his
      admonitions, contracted debts, and gambled away the means given me to
      discharge them? I had only to own the truth, and I should be immediately
      relieved&mdash;but to <i>me</i>, how bitter would be the humiliation&mdash;to
      <i>him</i>, how painful the disclosure! Hours passed: I cursed my folly;
      but still I could devise no plan to remedy it; and my brain was teeming
      with wild expedients, when a tap was heard at the door, and in glided my
      London Palinurus, the Colonel. In his look there was nothing consolatory,
      for the expression of his countenance was gloomy, as if he had been
      &ldquo;performing&rdquo; at a funeral. He sate down at my bed-side, took my hand in
      his, looked unutterable things, and then, in a broken voice, inquired
      tenderly after his &ldquo;dear friend&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My health, Colonel, is not affected, beyond a drunken head-ache; but on
      my conduct I cannot look back without self-reproach and shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother of Adelaide shrugged his shoulders to his ears, and then
      delivered himself of a speech, which seemed intended rather to be
      exculpatory of himself, than consolatory to me. According to his account,
      I would play madly on, Adelaide in despair quitted the room, he
      remonstrated&mdash;all to no purpose; for the demon of play had entered
      into me, and play I would. I lost the contents of my pocket-book, and &ldquo;the
      <i>leetle</i> note of hand to the Baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note of hand to the Baron!&rdquo; I exclaimed, springing bolt upright in the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was absolutely true; for a billet was brought me at the moment by the
      waiter, in which the nice old gentleman affectionately requested &ldquo;to know
      how I had rested the preceding night, with a casual inquiry at what bank
      my note for £120 should be presented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a time I could not believe the evidence of my eyes, but read the
      Baron&rsquo;s billet again and again. At last, I began to fancy I had been
      duped. In a moment, a flood of light poured upon my mind, a thousand
      trifles were recollected, and my worst suspicions were confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel remarked a change of countenance that threatened an explosion,
      and, pleading a forgotten engagement, he took a hurried leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, dressed, wrote twenty letters, and tore them; then ordered my gig,
      drove down two streets, and returned. I passed a miserable day&mdash;ate
      no dinner&mdash;drank brandy and water extensively; and retired to a
      private room, in a frame of mind which a demon might find pity for, to
      write letters. Write letters! Pshaw! merely blot paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight fell&mdash;my brain was half on fire&mdash;I rejected candles&mdash;the
      gloom of evening was best suited for the bitter musings of a mind like
      mine. I gazed from the window, objects passed, but I saw none of them. I
      heard the door open&mdash;a figure stood beside me. I looked carelessly up&mdash;it
      was Adelaide. In thought I was connecting her agency with the villany of
      her brother and the Baron&mdash;proofs against her appeared strong, and I
      had set her down a guilty thing. No wonder that I received her coldly; and
      my frigid civility semed to wound her more than actual rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are changed,&rdquo; said the Colonel&rsquo;s sister: &ldquo;had I visited you once, my
      reception would have been very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might,&rdquo; I said, coldly. &ldquo;I did not then believe that the Colonel was a
      scoundrel, the Baron a rogue, and yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a very convenient associate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can remain here but a few minutes. The errand is urgent&mdash;the time
      short.&rdquo; She took a small packet from her bosom, where it had been
      concealed, laid it on the table, and then proceeded. &ldquo;To a certain extent,
      I admit your charges. The statement of your being-plundered is correct,
      and the description of the plunderers is true; the Colonel was a
      fencing-master first, a cheat and thief afterwards. The Baron, I believe,
      a swindler from his cradle. Of me&mdash;ask not <i>what</i> I <i>was</i>&mdash;know
      what I am&mdash;a fallen woman&mdash;one who, in the common course of
      crime, has sunk by degrees, and at last, at twenty-one, become the
      confederate of thieves and ruffians. Oh Heaven! if women only knew what
      fearful penalties hang upon one lapse from virtue, how few would fall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wept. The tears were irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adelaide,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you must forgive me. I have been severe&mdash;my
      losses have annoyed me. What is that parcel you desire me to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your watch&mdash;I purloined it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, O&rsquo;Halloran&mdash;it was only to secure it. Hear me&mdash;a few
      minutes, and we part for ever. I am a woman&mdash;a lost one&mdash;but
      still my heart is not altogether callous. I saw you&mdash;you were young
      and unsuspicious, and became an easy victim. I watched the course of
      spoliation&mdash;you imagined that I lost money, and generously made me a
      recompense. Am I forgiven?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And <i>must I leave thee?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on my account, I trust,&rdquo; responded a voice, deep as that of Lablache,
      at our elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started&mdash;Adelaide hurried from the room&mdash;I remained, so did
      the stranger&mdash;Mr. Hartley!

      CHAPTER XVI. A SECOND DELIVERANCE.
    </h2>

      &ldquo;<i>Stockwell</i>. So, so, you seem disordered, Mr. Belcour.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Belcour. Disordered, sir!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Why did I ever quit the soil in which I grew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      The West Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or a minute the
      father of Isidora and I preserved a dignified silence. The stern
      displeasure his countenance evinced was not encouraging, and I looked the
      silliest young gentleman imaginable. The <i>contretemps</i> of this
      evening visit was most provoking. I had never done the sentimental in my
      life but twice, and on both occasions Mr. Hartley had managed to drop in.
      Turning his dark and searching eye on mine, he drily inquired, &ldquo;Whether it
      would be considered an impertinence on his part, if he asked who the lady
      might be whom he had very unintentionally put to flight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned her name, not forgetting to announce also the nobility of her
      descent; but had it been in direct line from Charlemagne or the Conqueror,
      it would not have propitiated Mr. Hartley, if one could form any opinion
      from the inauspicious &ldquo;humph!&rdquo; with which he received the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, my good sir, how long have you known this interesting personage?&rdquo; he
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since my arrival in London,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marvellous short time to ripen friendship to such full maturity! And
      what event might have called forth that storm of sobs and kisses which I
      so unluckily interrupted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A contemptuous sneer accompanied the inquiry that stung my pride, and I
      answered warmly, that &ldquo;I considered that he had neither authority nor
      interest to pry into matters with which he was wholly unconcerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No right, certainly,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;excepting that which former services
      may be fairly supposed to warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hartley,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I freely admit that I am indebted to you for
      hospitality, and also for deliverance from a disagreeable, and possibly a
      dangerous restraint; but surely one who rigidly interdicts inquiry into
      aught connected with himself, should also respect the secrets of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge the justice of your remark,&rdquo; said my quondam host; &ldquo;and the
      noble <i>demoiselle</i>, who hangs upon the neck of the acquaintance of a
      fortnight, discharging volleys of sighs, &lsquo;hot as a furnace,&rsquo; shall remain
      incognita. You own yourself indebted to me for former obligations; you
      have now a power of returning them; and I come here to ask a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is granted, sir,&rdquo; I replied, warmly, &ldquo;even before &lsquo;tis known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;it is a request that is too frequently
      refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the loan of money I solicit. The period brief; the repayment
      certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt my face redden, and could not find words to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I name the sum that I would borrow,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Hartley, without
      appearing to notice my confusion, &ldquo;and as the loan must be regulated by
      the state of your own finances, let me inquire what money you brought to
      town. Men coming to London are generally well provided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a question from a stranger! Surely I should resent it as impertinent.
      But no&mdash;the man appeared gifted with some influence that bent me to
      his will&mdash;and I muttered, that when I embarked for England my purse
      had contained two hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, not a bad supply. Could you with convenience spare me half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I groaned, and shook my head. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another and a more desponding shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be it forty. No answer. Thirty&mdash;twenty&mdash;ten! No answer
      yet? Then is my request refused? So much for the lip-gratitude of Mr.
      Hector O&rsquo;Halloran!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought my brain would madden, as the humiliating position to which my
      folly had reduced me, was thus rudely exposed by this tormenting
      supplicant. I tried to speak&mdash;&lsquo;twas useless; words would not come.
      Another minute passed&mdash;and Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s eyes were turned on mine, as
      if he would have read the secret agony of spirit which his importunity had
      caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;should I solicit five paltry pounds&mdash;would
      that small assistance be refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was torturous. My voice at last found utterance. I raised my
      eyes, and looked full at Mr. Hartley. How well that look betrayed my
      secret sufferings&mdash;the bitterest a man can know&mdash;those of
      self-contempt and conscious humiliation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I hundreds, Mr. Hartley, they should be placed freely at your
      disposal, and I should feel too proud in having the power of convincing
      you that I have not forgotten kindnesses. I want the means&mdash;for on
      yonder table lies all the money I am master of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;only a few shillings left of two hundred pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true, by Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, are you lower than the wretch who asks for alms upon the
      road-side. You are a pauper by vice; he a beggar through misfortune.
      Listen, boy, and learn how deep is your degradation. A man to whom you
      were indebted for good services seeks your assistance, and whatever might
      have been your wishes to render it, folly has placed the means beyond your
      reach; and, to a noble spirit, how painful is the inability of returning a
      former obligation! And for what did you deprive yourself of the power of
      being generous? To lavish money upon knaves and gamblers&mdash;or, still
      more wretched infatuation,&mdash;to win the heartless smiles of beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as if to observe the effect of his reproof, and one glance
      attested its influence. In my agitated countenance the inward workings of
      the breast were visible; for I had never felt the agony of conscious shame
      and self-reproach till now. No wonder that under such feelings, this
      singular personage elicited step by step, every particular touching my
      connexion with Santonier and his confederates. There are times when men
      feel their positions so intolerable, that, with despairing recklessness,
      they court no concealment, but place their offendings in their worst
      light. Such feelings were mine; and, undeterred by the strongly-expressed
      scorn and displeasure of Mr. Hartley, I brought the confessions of my
      folly to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My words have pained you?&mdash;it is all the better,&rdquo; continued my stern
      monitor, &ldquo;as it affords reasonable ground for hoping that the error lies
      in the head, and not in the heart. Vice has no blush; and, when the cheek
      reddens at the recollection of past imprudence, it may be expected that
      future follies will be eschewed. But how could you have been plundered so
      unsuspectingly? I only marvel that the veriest novice ever loosed upon a
      vicious town, could not in one day&rsquo;s acquaintance have detected the
      barefaced swindling of your noble friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know them?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and for that profitable knowledge I own myself indebted to Mr.
      Hector O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me, sir?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir, to you.&mdash;Have you forgotten my letter? and have I not
      apprised you that every action of your life is under the strictest <i>surveillance?</i>
      With all your movements, from the very night you entered London, I have
      been acquainted; and it is not wonderful that I should take some interest
      in ascertaining who were the intimate associates of a man, whose fortunes
      are to be made or marred by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a strange gentleman this Mr. Hartley was! He seemed to have selected
      me as a sort of shuttlecock wherewith to amuse himself at his own
      discretion, while with my future fortunes he modestly announced a
      determination, in Yankee parlance, to &ldquo;go the whole hog.&rdquo; Strange that I
      should passively submit to be thus painfully hectored by a stranger; and,
      with every inclination, want moral courage to rebel! The man was a mystery&mdash;he
      appeared to have a perfect knowledge of my actions, added to the gift of
      ubiquity. Did I ask an impertinent question, or perpetrate a kiss, he was
      sure to be close at my elbow. Was it not devilish hard, that a man could
      not commit his fooleries&mdash;as Sir Lucius O&rsquo;Trigger wished to fight&mdash;&ldquo;in
      peace and quietness?&rdquo; and, when he had lost his last guinea, that a
      gentleman should drop in, to deliver himself of an admonition first, and
      require the loan of a hundred afterwards? I had got myself into &ldquo;a regular
      fix,&rdquo;&mdash;and that seemed the signal for Mr. Hartley to appear at the
      moment when I wished him &ldquo;five fathom under the Rialto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One thing was indisputable&mdash;I had been sadly fooled. Circumstances
      smooth down misfortunes; and I have heard that men, who would be driven to
      desperation at being cheated by a thimble-rigger, feel it only an
      agreeable kind of sorrow in being swindled by a peer.&mdash;I wished to
      find out the real character of my plunderers; and it would be an
      unspeakable satisfaction to be certain that I had been &ldquo;cleaned out&rdquo; by
      the descendants of some &ldquo;baron bold&rdquo; who had tilted on the field of
      Agincourt, or at Pavia &ldquo;lost every thing but honour.&rdquo; Adelaide had
      described them as low-born swindlers, but she might be mistaken. Timidly,
      therefore, I hazarded the inquiry, whether &ldquo;Mr. Hartley knew the exact
      circle of society which Santonier and his companions appertained to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That question,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hartley, &ldquo;is a puzzler; for in every grade,
      from the highest to the lowest, you will find distinctions. The colonel&rsquo;s
      birth may be as noble as he insinuates it to be. He was an <i>enfant
      trouvé</i>, and in time, the foundling rose to be a valet. In the
      Revolution, his master lost his head, and Santonier his place; he next
      became a professional gambler; &lsquo;a master of fence&rsquo; afterwards&mdash;and
      lastly, the <i>chevalier d&rsquo;industrie</i> reached the climax of rascality,
      and acted as a double spy. The old gentleman, in green spectacles, has
      been all his life <i>attaché</i> to &lsquo;a hell.&rsquo; The lady&rsquo;s history can only
      be learned at the Palais Royal&mdash;and I doubt whether it would repay
      the trouble of a research. Although the struggle may be painful, still it
      is best to prepare you for the trial, a warrant from the Alien Office has
      directed your amiable acquaintances to withdraw&mdash;and before
      to-morrow&rsquo;s sun rises, the Santoniers will have departed. An hour since
      the Colonel and I had a satisfactory conversation. This money he requested
      me to deliver to you.&rdquo; (Here Mr. Hartley gave me some bank notes.) &ldquo;And,
      as to this security, it is now mine&mdash;and may I inquire, are you
      prepared to discharge it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the writing,&mdash;it was a promissory note bearing my signature,
      and covenanting to pay &ldquo;one hundred-and fifty pounds at sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you prepared to discharge this honourable engagement?&rdquo; he demanded,
      with affected seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we may as well cancel it at once;&rdquo; and as he spoke he tore the paper
      to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I not well, when I told you, that on me the colour of your future
      life depended? Remember this second deliverance&mdash;one, to which a
      week&rsquo;s imprisonment in the haunt of drunken outlaws were a mere nothing.
      But no more of this; we have other matters now to occupy us. I want you
      for an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat&mdash;desired me to follow him. I felt myself a mere
      puppet in his hands&mdash;bowed assent&mdash;and we left the hotel
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where was Isidora? The question was often on my lips; but my companion
      was a gentleman of such explosive temperament, that I dare not hazard the
      inquiry. He called a coach&mdash;I stepped in after him, obedient as a
      poodle&mdash;and, according to order, honest Jarvey rumbled his &ldquo;leathern
      conveniency&rdquo; to some caravanserai in the city, as much excluded from the
      Court Circular as Mr. Pryme&rsquo;s favourite <i>hostelrie</i>&mdash;the house
      with &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s head&rdquo; in Crutched Friars.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we rolled along the streets Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s manner assumed a different
      tone, for he talked to me with the familiarity of old acquaintanceship,
      and never for a moment recurred to my recent peccadillos. We spoke of the
      engrossing subjects of the day, and on every topic he displayed that
      peculiar knowledge, which one who has been long intimate with mankind only
      can acquire. Keen and correct as his observations were, they seemed to be
      those of a man who had quarrelled with the world; and, inexperienced as I
      was, I set him down to be one whose past career had been unfortunate, or
      whose future prospects were gloomy and uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we entered the hotel Mr. Hartley led the way to the apartments he
      occupied. They were situated at the extremity of a long corridor, and
      isolated from the other chambers of the inn. In an ante-room my old
      acquaintance Dominique was seated. Although his fanciful dress was
      discarded for a plain blue livery, I easily recognised my sable friend;
      and the negro&rsquo;s intelligent countenance brightened as he saw me, and
      offered a silent welcome. His master introduced me into a drawing-room,
      desired me to be seated, apologized for a short absence, and left me to
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange&mdash;during our long interview and drive, not a word of
      Isidora!&mdash;I had once asked simply if she were well, and he had
      replied in the affirmative so briefly, that it seemed to preclude any
      further inquiries touching his fair daughter. I examined the apartment&mdash;no
      tokens of female occupancy presented themselves&mdash;it was like the
      common-place chamber of every inn, and only remarkable for the numerous
      trunks and boxes it contained; and to judge from the extent of the
      baggage, the traveller to whom it appertained was preparing for a final
      flitting. The various packages had Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s name attached; and hence,
      I concluded that to Ireland he had bidden a long farewell. But brief space
      was permitted for solitary fancyings: the door opened,&mdash;my quondam
      host entered accompanied by a lady,&mdash;and one look told me that she
      was Isidora.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I advanced and took her hand, she coloured to the brow, but still my
      reception was a kind one. Meeting under different circumstances, we both
      felt less embarrassment than when I had been first presented to her; and I
      thought I could perceive something in Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s manner, which appeared
      to give encouragement to our closer intimacy. Occasionally he alluded to
      my last escapade in dry sarcastic observations, only intelligible to
      ourselves; but his manner satisfied me, that however foolish I might have
      appeared, still I had not fallen in his estimation. Supper ended, Isidora
      withdrew; we parted with &ldquo;a fair good night;&rdquo; and Mr. Hartley and I were
      left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My host looked at the door to see that it was closed, then filled his
      glass, and pushed the flask across to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; he commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started; for it was the first time he had ever addressed me without
      prefixing a formal <i>mister</i> to my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you are surprised to hear me speak to
      you with little ceremony. Did you but know the secret history of him who
      sits beside you, that wonder would be removed. The time for that is yet to
      come; and you must expect my confidence only as circumstances may require,
      and your own conduct shall deserve it. I told you that your fortunes were
      controlled by me; and on that assurance you may place the firmest
      reliance. Listen, and you may learn much concerning your own family&mdash;more
      than you have yet known&mdash;and, afterwards, I will explain the reason
      that made me thus communicative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, and remained a silent listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had an uncle. He was thrown upon the world unwisely when a boy, left
      to his own guidance, and subjected to more temptation than youth can
      conquer. Need I tell you, who have learned the lesson practically, how
      easily intimacies are formed, which, when unchecked, prove ruinous? By the
      ill-judging liberality of his father, young Clifford obtained the means to
      follow the bent of his inclination. His temper was ardent&mdash;his
      passions strong&mdash;he had no friend to counsel&mdash;no Mentor to
      direct&mdash;his life became a whirlwind of dissipation&mdash;and with
      rapid strides he hurried to destruction. Too late, the film was removed
      from his parent&rsquo;s eyes; and unfortunately, the steps he took to stay that
      course of folly in his child, which himself had first encouraged, were
      injudicious. Money was suddenly withheld; could the wild youth&rsquo;s career be
      thus arrested? No; false villains surrounded him, who pointed out easy
      means by which a large supply was raised, only, when obtained, to be
      wasted upon knaves, or lavished with reckless prodigality on those whose
      beauty had been their bane. Oh! woman&mdash;thou art a blessing or a curse&mdash;and
      as both, this withered heart has proved thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley sprang from his chair&mdash;strode aeross the room&mdash;stopped
      at the window&mdash;and then, as if he had subdued a violent outbreak of
      secret feeling, he resumed his seat and thus continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vicious career soon finds its termination. The mode by which young
      Clifford had hitherto obtained supplies at last became unavailing, and
      criminal means were cautiously proposed by his villanous confederates.
      From these the youth recoiled with horror&mdash;his guardian angel had not
      yet deserted him; and, like another prodigal, he half determined to fall
      at his father&rsquo;s feet, and ask him to bless and pardon. That blessing was
      ready had he sought it&mdash;but the moment of penitence had passed. One,
      with an angel form and demon heart, had thrown her spells around him; and
      all that remained of moral principle, she, the foul temptress, gradually
      extinguished. In a desperate emergency young Clifford committed forgery,
      affixing to securities of immense amount, his father&rsquo;s name. In due time
      the criminal act was discovered, and to the agonized parent one
      alternative alone was left&mdash;to pay an enormous sum to the villains
      who had demoralized him, or denounce his child a felon, and consign him to
      a felon&rsquo;s doom. He sacrificed the money. Did the mischief end there? No;&mdash;the
      misguided young man was now the victim of a gang of swindlers&mdash;the
      puppet of a coldblooded courtesan. Deeper and deeper they involved him,
      and at last, when their own detection was impending, they made him a
      scapegoat to their safety, and denounced their dupe for crimes which they
      had themselves committed, and of which he, poor wretch, was guiltless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fallen have no friends; and your uncle was obliged to evade the
      penalty which the law would have then exacted, by abandoning the country
      of his birth, to seek ignominious safety in a foreign land. There&mdash;he
      lived and died&mdash;a nameless fugitive. Heaven knows in what misery the
      remnant of his few and evil days were passed,&mdash;or, when the hour of
      deliverance came, under what fearful circumstances death claimed a willing
      victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley paused; the story of my unfortunate relative had affected me,
      and I expressed strong sympathy for the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;it is probable that his punishment was greater than
      his crime; but of that none but himself could tell. To proceed:&mdash;from
      the moment young Clifford quitted England, his father, by a mental
      exertion that almost appeal&rsquo;s incredible, seemed to forget that he had
      ever had a son, and centered all his hopes and his affections in the child
      still spared him; and your mother became the object that he lived for.
      There, too, it was decreed that his hopes and plans should be
      disappointed. He had resolved to ally her nobly; but his air-built castle
      was levelled to the earth. She eloped with a soldier of fortune; and worse
      still, in the estimation of one so deeply bigoted to his own faith, the
      husband she had selected was a Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he had banished from his heart the memory of a guilty son, so, also,
      he appears to have forgotten that a daughter, whose sole offence was love,
      has often sued for pardon, and sued in vain. Dead, apparently, to human
      passions, and wrapped in gloomy reveries of religion without any thing of
      its charities, he mistakes ascetic indifference for submission to that
      Will which rules the fate of mortals. In every thing he is directed by his
      confessor, and report affirms that he has bequeathed his fortune and
      estates to the uses of the Church of Rome. I have heard that you bear a
      striking likeness to your mother. Could you but meet this cold old man,
      possibly some spark of kindred love might still be latent in the heart,
      and in the living child, he might happily be forced to recollect the
      long-estranged mother. But to obtain that meeting is the difficulty.
      Surrounded by priests and spies, your very name, if known, would bar you
      from his presence. I have taken measures to ascertain what are the old
      man&rsquo;s habits, and how an interview might be accomplished. The experiment
      may fail&mdash;but still it is worth the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have I enlarged on what you knew partially already?&mdash;the fall of
      William Clifford. Only to show, by startling truths, that imprudence is
      too generally the path to crime; and that your career, unless arrested as
      it was by me, might have ended fatally as your uncle&rsquo;s did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I exclaimed, passionately; &ldquo;a fool I might be&mdash;a villain,
      never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so thought young Clifford once&mdash;but no more of this. I feel
      convinced that your fancy for play and dangerous acquaintances is ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Hartley, I see my folly in its true colours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for bed,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You to your hotel, and I to my chamber.
      Let me see you early to-morrow. Should business have called me from home,
      you will find Isidora, and her sable genius, Dominique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never travel far without your black attendant,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never leaves us; and for twenty years, amidst all its storm and
      sunshine, he has followed my fortunes with devoted fidelity. Next to that
      of my child, the greatest loss Heaven could inflict would be to take from
      me that faithful negro. He comes.&mdash;Show Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran down stairs.&mdash;Once
      more, good night.&rdquo; He shook me warmly by the hand. &ldquo;One word more, friend
      Hector,&rdquo; he added with a smile; &ldquo;you need not lose time in a visit to
      Jermyn-street&mdash;the birds have flown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was past midnight, if you could believe the watchman; and as I walked
      slowly westward, and thought on the events of the few last hours, I
      doubted their actual reality. The strange and quick succession in which
      they followed, seemed like the wanderings of a dream. A second time had I
      been delivered from a critical position by a person, two months ago a
      stranger&mdash;and yet one, who appeared to have dropped upon the earth,
      for the especial purpose of looking after me. I slept&mdash;many a vision
      passed &ldquo;in shadowy review.&rdquo;&mdash;but one, more brilliant than the rest,
      was ever before &ldquo;my mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Hartley, the genius of my good
      fortune, and Isidora, its bright reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said already, that the destinies of my foster-brother and myself
      were intimately united. Mark Antony left my father&rsquo;s house to join me in
      Dublin&mdash;the hand of fate had interposed&mdash;and on this eventful
      night, while I reposed at Stevens&rsquo;s, my <i>alter ego</i> was &ldquo;taking his
      rest&rdquo; in a back attic, two pair up, in a ramification of the Seven Dials&mdash;a
      safe and agreeable domicile, to which his friend, the ratcatcher, had
      introduced him. A cheaper lodging might have been certainly obtained; but
      this was quiet and select. From slates to cellar there were but seven
      families in the house&mdash;&ldquo;and the beauty of it was,&rdquo; as Shemus Rhua
      remarked with triumphant satisfaction, &ldquo;every soul of them was Irish.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII. THE ROBBERY OF TIM MALEY.

      &ldquo;<i>My father, the deacon, wrought him his first hose. Odd, I&rsquo;m thinking
      deacon Threeplie, the rape-spinner, will twist him his last cravat. Ay,
      ay, puir Robin is in a fair way o&rsquo; being hanged.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Rob Roy.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the &ldquo;sweet
      sorrow&rdquo; of parting with the <i>cantatrice</i>, the fosterer and his
      companion, as if striving to leave care behind, pushed forward vigorously
      on the road; and at sunset, the steeple of the village where they had
      determined to remain for the night, was visible from the high ground they
      were crossing. Never were fellow-travellers in more opposite moods; Mark
      Antony, melancholy as &ldquo;a lover&rsquo;s lute&rdquo;&mdash;the ratcatcher,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Brisk as a bee, light as a fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the matter might have been easily accounted for&mdash;the one had
      parted with a mistress&mdash;no wonder, therefore, that he, poor fellow,
      was sad enough; the other was levanting from a wife&mdash;consequently he
      was merry, &ldquo;and small blame to him,&rdquo; as they say in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my conscience, Mark, <i>astore</i>,&rdquo; * said Shemus Rhua,
      breaking a silence of five minutes, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re a pleasant companion this
      evening, if a man didn&rsquo;t care what he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglice&mdash;darling.
</pre>
    <p>
      The fosterer answered with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued the ratcatcher, &ldquo;were you married, like myself, you
      couldn&rsquo;t be much more miserable. Arrah! what the plague has come over ye,
      man? Can&rsquo;t ye take things asy like me? Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I left an affectionate wife
      behind?&mdash;and ye see I bear it like a Christian. I was once in love
      myself, and, as the sergeant&rsquo;s song goes, found nothing for it but whisky.
      So, there&rsquo;s a bridge, and here&rsquo;s the cruiskeeine; we&rsquo;ll sit down upon the
      wall for a while, take a drop to kill grief, and just inquire afterwards,
      where the devil we are going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the worthy captain unclosed his goat-skin knapsack&mdash;produced
      a flask and capacious drinking-cup, supplied the latter sparingly from the
      stream, completing it amply from the cruiskeeine&mdash;and after
      swallowing the larger moiety himself, he transferred &ldquo;love&rsquo;s panacea&rdquo; to
      his desponding comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Shemus Rhua, as the fosterer emptied the
      horn; &ldquo;and now, Mr. O&rsquo;Toole, will you tell me where I&rsquo;m bound for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; returned the fosterer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going to
      myself&mdash;nor do I care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two of us so,&rdquo; observed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll head towards England,&rdquo; said the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push on to London afterwards, and try an Irishman&rsquo;s luck.5,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; exclaimed the ratcatcher; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll stick to you like a bur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could you do there, copteeine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me rather what could I not do! Are there any brats, rats, pointers,
      or old women to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of all, no doubt, Master Shemus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then leave Shemus Rhua alone to make out life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, captain, if you will venture, we&rsquo;ll share the purse while it holds
      a shilling&mdash;and when the last is gone&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s only mounting
      the cockade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a gentleman like me,&rdquo; returned the ratcatcher with a smile, &ldquo;who had
      the honour to hold a commission, it would be beneath him to enlist; but,
      <i>mona-sin-dhoul!</i> wherever you go, Mark, I&rsquo;ll follow like your
      shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;night is falling, and the road, they
      say, is unsafe after dark. They robbed the mail last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not rob us,&rdquo; returned the ratcatcher. &ldquo;&lsquo;Where hard blows and
      light purses are only to be got, people who understand their business,
      never trouble themselves with such customers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Shemus, you know best; for you&rsquo;re foully belied, if there was a
      handier gentleman out in ninety-eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never robbed, if robbing you can call it,&rdquo; returned the captain, &ldquo;but
      twice; and if every thing I did besides sate as light upon my conscience,
      the devil a knee I need crook to Father McShane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who <i>did</i> you rob?&rdquo; inquired the ratcatcher&rsquo;s companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miser, and the king-God bless his majesty! I should have spared him-for
      he&rsquo;s a daeent ould gentleman, or my head would have been on a spike at
      Castlebar!&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Shemus, let us hear both exploits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I robbed the king, it was only taking saddle-bags from an honest
      tax-gatherer, whom I chanced to meet &lsquo;accidentally on purpose&rsquo; one
      winter&rsquo;s evening at the deer-park wall of Cloghanteeley&mdash;The man was
      drunk, the horse tired, and I took care of the silver&mdash;only that,
      forgetting the owner&rsquo;s name, I never knew where to return it afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the king,&rdquo; observed the fosterer; &ldquo;and now, gallant captain,
      for the miser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye that,&rdquo; replied the ratcatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was late in the winter, the year after the French, ** and Christmas
      Eve, into the bargain. Well, there was to be a cake *** at Croneeinbeg and
      as I was then fond of a dance, I set out after dark for the village.
      Before I got half-way, who should I meet but Mary Connor. She was the
      natest girl within thirty miles, and had been only married a bare
      fortnight. I heard her sob as I came up, and when I bid her the time of
      the day, she couldn&rsquo;t answer, the poor cratur, for the grief was fairly
      choking her. &lsquo;Death an&rsquo; nous,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;Mary darling, has any thing
      happened to yourself or the man that owns ye?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;copteeine avourneeine, **** only we&rsquo;re both fairly
      ruined.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ruined?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Och hone! it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth,&rsquo; says she-and
      between tears and sobs the poor girl managed to tell me her misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A disgusting penalty then attached to treason.

     ** In Connaught, for many years after Humbert&rsquo;s descent upon
     the coast of Mayo, events were dated from that occurrence.

      &ldquo;&lsquo;Copteeine,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;ye know Tim Maley of Ramore?&rsquo; &lsquo;Troth, and I do,&rsquo;

      skin-flint, who would rob his own father if he could. Whenever I want a
      sheep, I always give him the preference, and choose one that has his brand
      upon it.&rsquo; &lsquo;May the Lord reward ye,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;for so doing, Well,
      copteeine, for two years he has been comin&rsquo; about our place, and when the
      times got bad, and my father and my husband were druv&rsquo; for rent, they
      borrowed money at <i>gompeein</i> * from the miser. Well, they thought to
      pay it, with and with, ** but the crippawn *** seized the cattle, and the
      grate snow kilt the sheep, and the devil a <i>scurrick</i> could they make
      up between them for the ould sinner, when their note fell due. Well, ye
      know that Pat and I were promised for two years, but as the world went
      hard against us, we were afeard to get married. On Monday come three
      weeks, we were sittin&rsquo; round the fire, heavy-hearted enough, when the
      latch was lifted softly. I thought it was Pat, but who should it be but
      ould Maloy. In he comes, coughing, with his &ldquo;God save all here,&rdquo; and draws
      a stool to the fire. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;r kindly weleome,&rdquo; says my father. &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo;
       says the miser, &ldquo;for I am come for at laste a part of the money that you
      and Pat Grady, (manin&rsquo; my husband,) are due me.&rdquo; My poor father turned
      pale as a cloth. &ldquo;Mister Maley,&rdquo; says he, <i>mistering</i> the ould
      ruffin, to plase him ye know; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard of our loss&mdash;may the Lord
      look down upon us!&rdquo; The miser gave a cough, &ldquo;An&rsquo; am I,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to get
      nather less or more of what I lent ye?&rdquo; My poor father gave a groan.
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; says the ould divil to me, &ldquo;put the boult in the door, and come
      here and sit beside me.&rdquo; Well, copteeine, my heart grew cold, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t
      know why the fear came over me so, but I did what he desired me, and came
      and sate down, but with my father betune us. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says be, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      asking time, Phil Connor, an&rsquo; may be, I might give it to ye&mdash;ay, an&rsquo; 
      maybe I&rsquo;ll do more&mdash;for I&rsquo;ll make Mary my lawful wife, and forgive ye
      the debt along with it.&rdquo; The light left my eyes as he said so; and when my
      poor father looked over at me so heart-broken, I thought I would have
      dropped. &ldquo;What do ye say to the offer?&rdquo; said ould Maley. &ldquo;Och hone!&rdquo; says
      my father, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a grate honour ye do my little girl; but, Mister Maley,
      dear, ye&rsquo;r too ould for her.&rdquo; The miser bit his lip; &ldquo;An&rsquo; do ye refuse me
      for a son-in-law?&rdquo; says he, in a rage. &ldquo;Let me just talk to the gentleman,
      father darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says I, for I knew we were in the ould villain&rsquo;s power,
      and I thought that I might sofen him. My father left the cabin, ould Maley
      pulled in his stool, took me by the hand, and begun palaverin&rsquo; me,
      thinkin&rsquo; I would consint; &ldquo;And now, Mary,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what have ye to say?
      Take me, or lave me, as ye like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Maley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;maybe I may offind ye; but if I don&rsquo;t spake the
      truth, I&rsquo;ll be guilty before God. I love another dearly, and niver could
      like you; and think of the sin, and shame, and sorrow, it would cause, if
      I desarted him because he&rsquo;s poor, and married you because ye&rsquo;r rich. Look
      out for some woman of your own years, for ye&rsquo;ll niver be happy with a
      girl.&rdquo; He hardly waited to the end, but jumped upon his legs, and swarin&rsquo; 
      he would lave us without a cloot, **** and beggar us root and branch, he
      flung out of the cabin like a madman.

    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, copteeine, when Pat came afterwards, and heard the story, he
      cursed, and I cried, till, in sheer despair, we determined to marry at
      once&mdash;and, the Lord forgive us! we done it out of the face, and ran
      away next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, we thought that God would stand our friend, and that, bad as the
      ould miser was, sure he wouldn&rsquo;t ruin, out and out, two poor craturs that
      had just got married; but a week showed that Maley&mdash;bad luck attind
      him!&mdash;was bent on our destruction. One night, and unknownst to us,
      every four-footed baste my father or my husband owned, was driven to the
      pound, and yesterday they were canted for anything they would bring. Poor
      Pat returned three hours ago almost broken-hearted, and all I had to offer
      my weary husband was a dry potatoe.&rsquo; Poor girl! she burst into a flood of
      tears, and every sob she gave, I laid it heavy on my soul, ather to right
      her, or revenge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, copteeine,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;every cloot was sould but one milch-cow
      that fell lame upon the road: I looked at my husband&rsquo;s sorry dinner&mdash;and,
      for his sake, I determined to humble myself to that wicked ould man, and
      beg from him the lame cow. Off I set, unknownst to Pat, took the short cut
      across the fields, and in an hour reached Maley&rsquo;s. He looked at me as I
      entered the cabin, and the grin of hell was on his face. Well, he spoke me
      fairly at first; &ldquo;Come in, <i>astore</i>,&rdquo; he said, ladin&rsquo; me into the
      inside room. Feaks, I thought he was going to be kind at last; but och!
      copteeine, it was only mockery he meant after all. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so ye want the
      lame cow?&rdquo; says he, beginnin&rsquo; the conversation. &ldquo;Yis, Mister Maley,&rdquo; says
      I, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s agreeable to ye; I would ask it as a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; says he, pullin&rsquo; out a big key that was fastened to his waistcoat
      with a string, and opening a black oak chest that was standin&rsquo; at the foot
      of the bed. &ldquo;Do you see that bag, Mary?&rdquo; says he, pointin&rsquo; to a blue one.
      &ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Well, in that I brought home the price of the
      cattle. Do ye see that other striped one?&rdquo; says he. I told him that I did.
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the interest of what I lent the squire,&rdquo; and three or four
      other gentlemen he named. &ldquo;Now, Mary Connor,&rdquo; says he, shuttin&rsquo; down the
      lid and lockin&rsquo; the chest again, &ldquo;if sixpence would save you from
      starvin&rsquo;, and Pat Grady from a jail, be this book,&rdquo; and he kissed the key,
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give it if you were on the gallows.&rdquo; I rushed out from the
      ould villain&rsquo;s sight. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he cried, shoutin&rsquo; from the windy; &ldquo;as soon
      as the lame cow can walk, she&rsquo;ll go where the others went yesterday.
      There&rsquo;s a cake, I hear, the night at Croneeinbeg.&mdash;You&rsquo;ll be dancin&rsquo; 
      there, I think&mdash;ye know the heel&rsquo;s light, where the heart&rsquo;s merry&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it, Mary Connor?&rdquo; and till I was out of bearin&rsquo;, that fiend&rsquo;s laugh
      pierced me to the soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mark, I had made up my mind, before the poor girl had done
      speakin.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; says I &lsquo;the ould monster shall tell truth for once. Go
      home&mdash;dress yourself in your best&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be my partner to-night
      at Croneeinbeg&mdash;ay, and, by Heaven! there sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a lighter foot
      upon the floor, nor a merrier heart lavin&rsquo; the dance-house than your own,
      Mary Connor!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She stared&mdash;but I pressed lier to do what I wished, and she promised
      it. I waited till she was out of sight, and then jogged quietly on towards
      the place wore Maley lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got within sight of the house, I thought it rather too early to
      pay a visit to the miser, and steppin&rsquo; into a quarry, sate down to let
      another hour pass. Maley knew me well; but as I had a crape in my pocket,
      I determined to disguise myself, pass for Johnny Gibbons, * and give him
      the credit of the job. Presently I heard footstep on the road, and up came
      three men. They did not see me, but I heard them talkin&rsquo;. One of them was
      Maley&rsquo;s boy, and he was tellin&rsquo; his companions how nicely he had given his
      master the slip, and stole away without his knowin&rsquo; it. &lsquo;If the cows brake
      loose,&rsquo; says he, the &lsquo;divil a man-body&rsquo;s about the place to tie them.&rsquo; Oh,
      ho! thought I to myself, sorrow a better evening I could have chosen to
      visit ye, Mister Maley. So when the boys were out of bearin&rsquo;, I rose up,
      and reached the miser&rsquo;s without meetin&rsquo; a living soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I peeped quietly through the windy, an&rsquo; there was sittin&rsquo; the ould villin
      two-double over a few coals upon the hearth&mdash;for he begrudged himself
      a dacent fire&mdash;and two women were spinnin&rsquo; in the corner. A dog that
      came out of the barn knew me to be strange, and set up the bark.&mdash;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s
      that Cusdhu&rsquo;s ** growlin&rsquo; at?&rsquo; said ould Maley, sharply&mdash;&lsquo;Go out,
      Brideeine, and see.&rsquo; I lifts the latch, and quietly steps in. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no
      occasion, Mister Maley,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an ould friend who was passin&rsquo; the
      road, and dropped in to ask ye how ye were.&rsquo; The women gave a squall, and
      I thought the miser would have dropped out of the chair where he was
      sittin.&rsquo; &lsquo;Girls,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stand no nonsense. Ye have heard of Johnny
      Gibbons, I suppose.&rsquo; Both dropt upon their knees, and Maley began to cross
      himself.&mdash;&lsquo;Up with ye,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Go into that room, and if ather you
      brathe a whisper that would waken the cat, I&rsquo;ll drive a ball thro&rsquo; ach
      o&rsquo;ye.&rdquo;

      after them. Well, I laid the gun upon the dresser, drew a stool, an&rsquo; sits
      down fornent the miser. &lsquo;Arrah, bad luck attend ye for an ould thief,&rsquo; 
      says I; &lsquo;hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ye the manners to ask a man who has come ten miles to see
      ye, whether he has a mouth or not?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh! Mister Gibbons, jewel, it was all
      a forget on my part. There&rsquo;s a bottle of licker in the cupboard.&rsquo; &lsquo;An&rsquo; the

      to the room with me, if ye plase.&rsquo; &lsquo;Arrah,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;what de ye want
      there?&rsquo; I niver answered him, but took out a pistol carelessly from my
      coat pocket, opened the pan, shook the primin&rsquo;, and looked at the flint.
      &lsquo;Christ stan&rsquo; between us an&rsquo; harm! what are ye about?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; 
      says I; &lsquo;only that I always see if the tools are in proper order before
      they&rsquo;r wanted.

      Come along.&rsquo; &ldquo;Well, he followed me like a spaniel&mdash;in we goes to the
      room&mdash;and in a moment I spied the black oak chest. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the key
      of this?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;God sees it&rsquo;s lost since the fair of Ballyhain, and
      that&rsquo;s a fortnight come Saturday,&rsquo; said the ould miser. &lsquo;Bad luck to the
      liars,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a quare thing, now, if I could find it?&rsquo; 
      With that I gives his waistcoat a rug, and out drops the key danglin&rsquo; to a
      bit of twine. The moment I put it in the chest, Maley roared &lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; an&rsquo; 
      threw himself across the lid. I lifted him by the neck as ye would lift a
      cur&mdash;flung him on the bed&mdash;tied him hand an&rsquo; foot with a hank of
      yarn&mdash;and stuffed an ould stockin&rsquo; in his mouth. &lsquo;Lie quiet there,&rsquo; 
      says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not detain ye long; for all I want here is a blue bag, an&rsquo; a
      striped one.&rsquo; The ould divil struv to shout, but the stockin&rsquo; smothered
      his voice, an&rsquo; the noise he made was so droll, that I couldn&rsquo;t help
      laughin&rsquo; till I was tired again. Well, sure enough there were the bags,
      just as Mary Connor had tould me. I put them in the pockets of my <i>cota

      &ldquo;Well, off I goes straight to Croneeinbeg&mdash;steps into the
      dance-house, an&rsquo; salutes the company with a &lsquo;God save all here.&rsquo; Divil a
      merrier set ye iver looked at, but two&mdash;an&rsquo; they were sittin&rsquo; in the
      corner. It was poor Grady an&rsquo; his wife&mdash;an&rsquo;, pon my soul! there was
      such sorrow on their pale faces, that an enemy would have pitied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want ye, Pat, says I.&rsquo; Up he gets, an&rsquo; we stept out together, and
      walked five or six perches from the house. &lsquo;Pat, what&rsquo;s the matter with
      ye, man?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ohone, copteeine; ye know I&rsquo;m ruined,&rsquo; says he. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
      it for myself, but&mdash;my poor Mary&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he fairly began to cry.
      &lsquo;Arrah!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;have done, man. De ye remember the night before Garlick
      Sunday?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Then, Pat Grady, <i>I do</i>. Ye hid me, when the
      highlanmen had run me to a stan&rsquo;-still&mdash;and, with an hundred pound
      upon my head, saved me when I thought none but God could deliver me from
      certain death. In that bag you&rsquo;ll find some money&mdash;your debt to Maley
      is paid&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a trifle to begin the world with. Go off. Hide
      it &lsquo;till ye want it; burn the bag; an&rsquo; now, you and I, Pat, have cleared
      scores; an&rsquo; if ten pound will do it, the cake shall be Mary Connor&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Oh! copteeine, jewel, let me but whisper to Mary our good luck;&rsquo; and in
      the poor fellow run, to spake comfort to the prettiest girl in the
      province.

      &ldquo;In a few minutes I returned to the dance. I looked at Mary Connor. The
      rose had come back again to her cheek, and at her bright black eye ye
      could have lighted a dhudeeine. &lsquo;<i>The floor!</i>&rsquo; says I&mdash;and in a

      Indeed, in its external appearance, the village inn had nothing to excite
      the expectations of a traveller. The windows were mostly without glass;
      the earthen floor broken into ruts, all of which appeared recipients for
      dirty water; while the ceiling was blackened with soot, and the walls
      curtained with cobwebs. The landlord, looked a sot&mdash;his helpmate, the
      epitome of every thing unclean. The ratcatcher pronounced it &ldquo;a place not
      fit to lodge a dacent dog in,&rdquo; while Mark Antony, remembering that
      hostelrie, where he had found &ldquo;the warmest welcome,&rdquo; drew a mental
      contrast between both, and thought with a sigh upon his rejected

      for a Wife.</i>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he man might have
      been set down a lazy wayfarer indeed who would have sojourned a second day
      at that pleasant hostlerie, whose sign-board displayed the spirited
      representation we have copied. Mark Antony avowed that &ldquo;he had never
      closed an eye,&rdquo; while his companion admitted the enjoyment of a short, but
      not sweet season of forgetfulness, when, according to the confessions of
      the captain, the insect tribe had assailed his person with such ferocity,
      that, had they only combined their efforts, &ldquo;and pulled one way, they must
      have dragged him into the floor.&rdquo; No wonder, then, that the journey was
      resumed at cockcrow. England was the destination; and the route was
      accordingly directed towards a neighbouring seaport, from which a passage
      in a trading vessel to Liverpool might be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that period&mdash;one short to look back to&mdash;the transit of the
      Channel was held to be a daring exploit; and, in Irish estimation, England
      was indeed, a land beyond the seas. Whether business or pleasure formed
      the inducement, the latter must be considerable, before a votary of St.
      Patrick would venture upon &ldquo;realms unknown and great,&rdquo; therefore was the
      fosterer&rsquo;s satisfaction, in discovering that Shemus Rhua was an
      accomplished traveller, and also that, in earlier life, the gallant
      captain had visited &ldquo;the great metropolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now three-and-twenty years ago,&rdquo; concluded the ratcatcher, with a
      sigh, &ldquo;and, upon my conscience, to look back, Mark dear, it appears like
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what brought you to England, Shemus?&rdquo; said the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;a gentleman who has directed me
      generally from the cradle. He keeps, they say, a warm house; and, though
      he&rsquo;s the best friend they have, the clargy are eternally abusing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by your own account, copteeine, your guide was none of the best.
      The errand, I hope, was better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neeil an suggum,&rdquo; * returned the ratcatcher, &ldquo;I went to run away with an

    <p>
      &ldquo;Succeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the ratcatcher; &ldquo;Upon my soul, only we gave leg-bail,
      he would have been hanged, and I left for transportation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He!</i>&mdash;who was he, Shemus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who but my ould master&rsquo;s son, Dick Macnamara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the expedition was unfortunate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate! how could it be otherwise?&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;Of all the
      unlucky devils ever born under a cross-grained star, Dick Macnamara, you
      were the most unlucky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; said the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! to be sure he is,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;He quarrelled with Savey
      Blake, at the winter fair of Athlone; and, as the morning was wet, they
      fought in the inn yard. What did the stupid fool his second do, but stick
      Dick into a corner! The rain was in his face; and at the first fire, Savey
      Blake, shot him like a woodcock. I was with him till he died. Indeed, I
      never knew him have luck but once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed; and what was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he did marry, his wife ran away from him within a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your English expedition, Shemus. Arrah, man, there&rsquo;s where the shoe
      pinches; and I would like to know how ye got on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got on!&rdquo; exclaimed the ratcatcher. &ldquo;Be gogstay! from the very moment we
      left home, every thing went wrong with us. But, stop&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there a
      well that none but a sinful man would pass? Sit down, <i>avourneeine</i>&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      a drop in the cruiskeein still, and when I take a cobweb out of my throat,
      I&rsquo;ll tell ye all the particulars of,

    <h3>
      THE MATRIMONIAL ADVENTURES OF DICK MACNAMARA
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was the summer after the great election&mdash;and that was in the year
      ninety-one&mdash;and a fine evening it was. At that time, care was far
      from my Heart, and I was taking a dance in the barn with Mary Regan, my
      lady&rsquo;s maid, when out comes Sir Thomas&rsquo;s own man to say that I was wanted
      in the parlour. &ldquo;Run, bad luck to ye,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll finish the jig
      for ye! Arrah, make haste, man! Some etarnal villin has slipt a paper
      under the gate, and the ould master&rsquo;s fit to be tied. I never saw him so
      mad since he was chased home from Galway.&rdquo; Away I goes; and when I got
      into the parlour, there I found Sir Thomas, God rest his soul! Father Pat
      Butler, the parish priest&mdash;and the driver, Izzy Blake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was sittin&rsquo; in the big armed chair he always sate in. He wasn&rsquo;t
      to say much the worse for liker; but it was asy to persave that he had
      been lookin&rsquo; at somebody that was drinkin&rsquo;. The priest, och! what a head
      he had! was cool as a cowcumber, and only Izzy&rsquo;s nose was a deeper purple
      than when he sate down, you wouldn&rsquo;t know he had a drop in. It was quite
      plain the party were in trouble; for, to smother grief, the ould master
      had slipped a second glass of poteeine into his tumbler just as I came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asy, Sir Thomas!&mdash;Drink asy!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;The whisky&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; 
      ye by inches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, balderdash! Pat Butler, won&rsquo;t ye let me take the colour of death
      off the water, man, and me threatened with the gout? It&rsquo;s the law that&rsquo;s
      fairly murderin&rsquo; me. Bad luck attend all consarned with the same! At the
      blast of the mail horn my heart bates like a bird; for within the last two
      years I have got as many lattitats by post, as would paper the
      drawin&rsquo;-room. Shemus Rhua,&rdquo; says he, turning to me,&mdash;&ldquo;did ye see a
      black-lookin&rsquo; thief about the place, when ye were hunting the young
      setters on the moor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Sir Thomas, if I did, don&rsquo;t ye think I would have been after
      askin&rsquo; him what he was doin&rsquo; there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sibby Byrn saw him thrust these d____d papers under the gate, and then
      cut over the bog as if the divil was at his heels. Well&mdash;small blame
      to him for runnin&rsquo;&mdash;for, by all that&rsquo;s beautiful, if I had gripped
      him, he would have gone back to the villain that employs him, lighter by
      both lugs. Sit down, Shemus. Izzy Blake, fill the boy a glass.&rdquo; And then
      he began, poor ould gentleman, askin&rsquo; me about the dogs; but before I
      could answer him, he gave a sigh. &ldquo;Arrah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what need I be
      talkin&rsquo; about dogs, when, after November next, the divil a four-footed
      baste will be left upon Killcrogher, good nor bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must be done immediately,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;If they foreclose
      the mortgage, and get a recaver on the estate, we&rsquo;re done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only raise five thousand to pay that cursed claim, we might
      stave off the other things till some good luck would turn up,&rdquo; said the
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas sighed. Troth, an enemy would have pitied him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Izzy Blake&mdash;that day will never come! Don&rsquo;t talk of good
      luck, that&rsquo;s over with me,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;O Lord! to be baten by Peter Daly&mdash;and
      his grandmother before him, keepin&rsquo; a huxtery in Loughrea&mdash;and then
      to be hunted home afterwards, like a tithe-proctor! It&rsquo;s enough to drive a
      man to drink, or make a quaker kick his own mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You see, Mark, (observed the captain, in explanation,) the ould master had
      stood for the county. Well, from the time he came into possession of the
      estate, of course, Sir Thomas was like his father, a Sunday man and as he
      couldn&rsquo;t meet the sheriff openly at the election, what the divil does he
      do, but he sits out in a boat, where he could hear how things were goin&rsquo; 
      on, and give orders to the tenants. The Lord sees, the cratures did all
      they could for a good master as he was. Didn&rsquo;t they kidnap the electors,
      tare down the booths, burn Peter Daly&rsquo;s talley-room teetotally,&mdash;and
      throw a jaunting car, with six voters, clane over the bridge&mdash;horse,
      driver, and all! And what more; could they do? The money bate us in the
      long-run; and it was well Sir Thomas wasn&rsquo;t taken into the bargain&mdash;for
      the bailiffs chased him to the very gates. No wonder then, poor ould
      gentleman, that the very name of the election put him always into a rage.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  In olden time, Irish gentlemen found it occasionally
     convenient to rest from their labours for six days, and only
     exhibit their persons on the seventh.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the priest, striving to say something pleasant, and
      comfort the ould master; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long lane that wants a turn&mdash;and
      luck will come at last. There&rsquo;s yer two sisters, Sir Thomas&mdash;the best
      catholics in Connemara, and ready to travel any moment that they&rsquo;re wanted&mdash;if
      the Lord would only mercifully take them to himself. Indeed, they&rsquo;re too
      good for this wicked world&mdash;and they would be far snugger in the
      next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a chance there,&rdquo; says Sir Thomas; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re the very counterpart of
      their mother&mdash;the Lord be good to her! an she lived to ninety-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye in the lottery the year?&rdquo; asked the priest. &ldquo;Arrah, what matter
      whether I am or not!&rdquo; said Sir Thomas. &ldquo;Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I been in it since I was a
      boy, and niver won any thing beyond a blackguard twenty or two? Upon my
      conscience, I verily believe, if I had been bound to a hatter, people
      would be born without heads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, the divil a one could point out the likelihood of luck; and the poor
      ould gentleman seemed mighty disconsolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;hould up, Sir Thomas&mdash;who knows but we&rsquo;ll get to
      the sunny side of the hedge yet? There&rsquo;s Master Dick&mdash;and if he would
      only marry an heiress&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be dad,&rdquo; says the ould gentleman, &ldquo;Father Pat, there&rsquo;s sense in that.&rdquo;
       The priest shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; says Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; returned the priest, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s never out of one scrape till he&rsquo;s
      into another. And then he&rsquo;s so captious; if he was in heaven&mdash;where
      the Lord send him in proper time, if possible!&mdash;why, he would pick a
      quarrel with St. Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a flow of spirit,&rdquo; says the ould man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a flow of spirits</i> that causes it generally,&rdquo; says the priest;
      &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all your own fault, Sir Thomas, and I often tould ye so. Instead
      of lettin&rsquo; him stick to his larnin&rsquo;, ye would have him brought up yer own
      way, ridin&rsquo; three times a week to the Clonsallagh hounds, and shooting at
      chalked men on the barn door through the remainder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, be quiet,&rdquo; says the ould gentleman. &ldquo;Though he&rsquo;s my son&mdash;at
      laste I have his mother&rsquo;s word for it&mdash;is there a nater horseman
      within the Shannon? Put Dick Macnamara on the pig-skin with any thing
      daeent anunder him, and I&rsquo;ll back him over a sportin&rsquo; country for all I&rsquo;m
      worth in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the priest, in a side-whisper; &ldquo;and if ye lost, the divil a
      much the winner would be the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s six feet in his stockings&mdash;sound as a bell&mdash;he&rsquo;ll throw
      any man of his inches in the province, and dance the <i>pater-o-pee</i> *
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah,&rdquo; says the priest, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s no way of payin&rsquo; the mortgage but by
      dancin&rsquo; the <i>pater-o-pee</i>, out we bundle at November.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A dance peculiar to Connemara.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t he marry an heiress?&rdquo; says the ould man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; says Father Butler, &ldquo;because he has no luck; and second, because
      he has no larnin&rsquo;. Wasn&rsquo;t I returnin&rsquo; from a sick-call only yesterday, and
      as God&rsquo;s goodness would have it, didn&rsquo;t I meet my Lady French&rsquo;s messenger
      with a note?&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that from?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Mr. Dick Macnamara,&rsquo; says
      he. Well, I had a misdoubtin&rsquo; about it, and so I opens the note&mdash;and&mdash;<i>Mona-sin-dhiaoul!</i>&mdash;Lord
      forgive me for sayin&rsquo; so!&mdash;if he hadn&rsquo;t spelt &lsquo;compliments&rsquo; with a
      K!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he spelt it with two K&rsquo;s,&rdquo; says the ould gentleman, &ldquo;will that
      hinder him marryin&rsquo; a woman if she wants a husband? I tell ye what,
      there&rsquo;s more sense in what Shemus Rhua says than any of ye seems to know.
      Wasn&rsquo;t the family as badly off when my grandfather&mdash;God rest his
      soul!&mdash;ran away with Miss Kelly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where will you get a Miss Kelly now-a-days? It&rsquo;s not out of every
      bush you&rsquo;ll kick a lady, lame of a leg, and twenty thousand down upon the
      nail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she the worse for that?&rdquo; says Sir Thomas. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye mind what my
      grandfather said to Lord Castletown the week after. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I,&rsquo; says my
      grandfather, &lsquo;manage the matter well, my lord?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ye did in troth, Ulic&mdash;and
      ye made a grate hit of it, if ye&rsquo;r amiable lady was only right upon the
      pins.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, my lord,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;what the divil matter if she is a
      wee bit lame? Does your lordship suppose, that men marry wives to run
      races with them?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, there&rsquo;s no use makin&rsquo; a long story about it. At Killcrogher things
      couldn&rsquo;t be worse than they were; and, when we had finished a second
      bottle of poteeine, we all agreed that the divil a chance, good, bad, or
      indifferent, was left, but for Dick Macnamara to marry a wife with a
      fortune&mdash;and with or without a spavin&mdash;-just as the Lord would
      direct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all mighty well, but where was the lady to be found? Of
      heiresses, there was no scarcity in Galway, if their own story was but
      true; but then their fortunes were so well secured, that nather principal
      nor interest could be got at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; says the ould master. &ldquo;Dick would get twenty
      thousand for the askin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is he to go there?&rdquo; says the priest. &ldquo;He must travel like a
      gentleman, or they wouldn&rsquo;t touch him with a tent pole&mdash;and where&rsquo;s
      the money for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Izzy drive the tenants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Sir Thomas! it&rsquo;s asy talkin&rsquo;&mdash;the divil a pound I could drive
      out of them to save yer life. <i>Mona-sin-dhiaoul!</i> ye might as well
      expect blood from a turnip, or to borrow knee-buckles off a Hielanman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were fairly nonplushed for a time, but we got matters right
      afterwards. The ould ladies, the master&rsquo;s sisters, had a trifle by them,
      if any body could manage to get at it. Well, the priest put it to them,
      for the glory of God; and Sir Thomas, for the honour of the family. They
      came down at last, and, between them, for a hundred. Sir Thomas lent us
      his own pistols, and Izzy Blake passed his word in Galway for the clothes.
      By St. Patrick! we were in such bad credit there, that over the whole town
      we wouldn&rsquo;t have got as much as would have made a surtout for a Lochryman.
      * On the strength of Izzy, however, we taught book-keeping to a tailor.
      His name, I mind, was Jerry Riley&mdash;and I fancy we&rsquo;re in his ledger to
      this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll never forget the mornin&rsquo; we started. &ldquo;We set out at six o&rsquo;clock, as
      we had to ride to Moylough to catch the Tuam mail. Every soul in
      Killerogher was astir, and waitin&rsquo; at door or windy to see us off&mdash;some
      givin&rsquo; their blessin&rsquo;, and others their good advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind yer eye, Dick!&rdquo; said the ould gentleman from the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any thing but what&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; cried the priest from the hall
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember you&rsquo;re of the Coolavins by the mother&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; called my lady
      from her bed-room; &ldquo;so look to blood as well as suet, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money&mdash;the money,&rdquo; cried the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, dear, ye&rsquo;re on book-oath to me!&rdquo; whispered Mary Regan, as we passed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be quarrelling about trifles,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor let any body tramp upon your corn, for all that,&rsquo; cried Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money&mdash;the money, Dick&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the last words of ye&rsquo;r
      clargy,&rdquo; roared the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t miss mass, if you can,&rdquo; screamed the ould ladies from the lobby. &ldquo;<i>Ara-gud-neeish!</i>&rdquo;
       ** and father Butler signed his blessing after us as we rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; roared the ould master. &ldquo;Another word, and God keep ye,
      Dick! Always fight with ye&rsquo;r back to the sun. Drink slow&mdash;don&rsquo;t mix
      ye&rsquo;r licker, nor sit with ye&rsquo;r baek to the fire&mdash;and the divil won&rsquo;t
      put ye under the table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were the last words we heard&mdash;the gatekeeper&rsquo;s wife flung an
      ould shoe after us for luck&mdash;and away we went to make our fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached Moylough, the coach was standin&rsquo; before the door of the
      hotel, for the passengers had gone in to breakfast; and by the time we had
      taken the dust out of our throats with a throw at the counter, the company
      had come out again. Two or three of them roofed it like myself; and one
      lady, with blue feathers and a yalla pelisse, stepped inside. She was a
      clipper! and there was enough of her into the bargain. As Master Diek
      travelled like a raal gentleman, of coorse, he hopped in too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when we stopped to change horses, Dick and the lady were thick as
      inkle-wavers. &ldquo;Shemus,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;bring out a glass of sherry, and a drop
      of water in the bottom of a tumbler, with a sketch of sperits through it.&rdquo;
       They drank genteely to each other, and away we rowled again. Indeed, at
      every stop the same order was repated.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      The lady was comin&rsquo; from the saa, and that made her dry, I suppose; and
      from the time he was a boy, Dick Macnamara had an unquenchable thirst upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Athlone in the evening, and stopped at the Red Lion. Dick
      handed out the lady with the yalla pelisse; and ye would have thought they
      would have shaken each other&rsquo;s hands off. Well, a maid-sarvant took her
      bandbox&mdash;Dick give her the arm&mdash;away they flourished together&mdash;and
      I stayed at the inn door to see the luggage safe off the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the young master returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shemus,&rdquo; says he, shuttin&rsquo; the door behind him, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t Miss Callaghan a
      spanker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my soul, she&rsquo;s a cliver girl, with line action,&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad luck to ye!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye talk of her as ye would of a horse. But,
      Shemus, I thought as we were all alone, I would try if I could put my <i>comether</i>
      over her by the way of practice. Och! if she was only an heiress! When I
      kissed her at partin&rsquo; in the hall, she tould me she could follow me over
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, after we had supped, Master Dick sends for me to come up stairs; and
      as it was too soon to go to bed, down we sate over a hot tumbler to settle
      what was to be done when we got to London. Ye see, we knew that in England
      there were heiresses <i>galore</i> *&mdash;but the thing was, how the
      divil were we to find them?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglicê&mdash;In plenty.
</pre>
    <p>
      Well, after we had been talkin&rsquo; half an hour, in comes the waiter. &ldquo;Is
      there one Mister Macnamara here?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Dick answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Callaghan&rsquo;s after askin&rsquo; for ye,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parade him,&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in steps an ould gentleman, clane shaved enough, but about the clothes,
      he had rather a shuck appearance. He bows, and Dick bows&mdash;and down
      sits the ould gentleman, an&rsquo; draws over a tumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye had a pleasant journey of it, Mister Macnamara,&rdquo; says he, commencin&rsquo; 
      the conversation. &ldquo;My daughter says that ye&rsquo;re the best of company. In
      troth, she spakes large of ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that they drinks one another&rsquo;s health&mdash;an&rsquo; from one thing they
      comes on to another. I had pulled my chair away to the corner, ye see, but
      Dick winked to me as much as to say, &ldquo;Shemus, stay where ye are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; so ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to better yourself with a wife?&rdquo; says the ould fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no denyin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;pon my conscience, it&rsquo;s the best thing ivir a young man did, for
      it keeps him out of harm&rsquo;s way. An&rsquo; are ye for soon changin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;r state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a use tellin&rsquo; lies among friends,&rdquo; says Dick. &ldquo;The sooner the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feath&mdash;an&rsquo; it has come rather sudden upon Sophy,&rdquo; says Mister
      Callaghan. &ldquo;But, God&rsquo;s will be done! Her brother will be home in an hour.
      I wish there was only time to send for her mother to Roscrea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted with her mother?&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; partikler,&rdquo; says Mr. Callaghan, &ldquo;only the ould lady would like to
      see her little girl married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; when is she to be married?&rdquo; inquired Dick. &ldquo;Why, as there seems to be
      a hurry,&rdquo; replies the ould fellow, &ldquo;it may as well be done &lsquo;out of the
      face.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; if it wouldn&rsquo;t be an impertinent question,&rdquo; says Dick, &ldquo;arrah! who&rsquo;s
      to be the happy man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; are ye jokin&rsquo;?&rdquo; says ould Callaghan. &ldquo;Arrah, who should it be, but
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself?&rdquo; says Dick. &ldquo;Shemus,&rdquo; says he&mdash;&ldquo;the divil an appearance of
      liker&rsquo;s on the ould man, what does he mane at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to marry his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; cried ould Callaghan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s not married till she marries me, she&rsquo;ll be single for a month of
      Sundays,&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up jumps the ould fellow in a rage&mdash;and up jumps Dick Macnamara&mdash;and
      then such fendin&rsquo; and provin&rsquo;, and such racketting through the room&mdash;till
      out rushed Mister Callaghan, swarin&rsquo; he would be revenged before he slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he slammed to the door, I turns round to Dick, to ask what it was
      all about?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, the divil have them that knows,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I just coorted a little
      bit with the girl as we were alone in the coach, by the way of bringin&rsquo; my
      han&rsquo; in before we got to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be my soul,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve made a nate kettle of fish of it!&mdash;Arrah,
      Dick, <i>avourneeine</i>&mdash;ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ye in the centre of a hobble&mdash;coorting&rsquo;s
      one thing, and marryin&rsquo;s another&mdash;Wouldn&rsquo;t the priest be proud of ye
      to go back with Miss Callaghan under ye&rsquo;re arm?&mdash;and with about as
      much money as would pay turnpike for a walking stick.&rdquo; Feaks, things
      looked but quare the more we considered them; so we thought we would order
      a chaise, push on to Moate, and lave Sophy Callaghan to her own amiable
      family, as she was too valuable for us. But, as matters turned up, we
      wer&rsquo;n&rsquo;t allowed to set off as asy as we intended. Before the chaise could
      come round, we heard feet upon the stairs, and the door opens, and in
      comes five as loose lookin&rsquo; lads as ye would meet in a day&rsquo;s walk. They
      were all fresh, as if they had been hard at the drinkin&rsquo;,&mdash;and they
      were bent on mischief,&mdash;for the second fellow had a twist in the eye,
      and a pistol-case under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Macnamara,&rdquo; says the first, &ldquo;my name&rsquo;s Callaghan. There&rsquo;s no use
      for any rigmarole, as the light&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; fast, so I just stepped in to ask
      you consarnin&rsquo; your intentions towards my sister Sophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The divil an intention have I, good or bad, about ye&rsquo;r sister Sophy,&rdquo;
       replied Dick, as stiff as a churchwarden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye can be at no loss to guess the consequence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks, an&rsquo; I am,&rdquo; says Dick; &ldquo;as I&rsquo;m no conjuror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye don&rsquo;t marry her within an hour,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be after sayin&rsquo; 
      something disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not keep ye in suspense half the time,&rdquo; replied Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;ll marry her?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were nivir more astray,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;since ye were born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll trouble ye for satisfaction,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;would fit ye&rsquo;r convanience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rather in a hurry,&rdquo; says Dick, pointin&rsquo; to the post-chay that had
      come round, and on which the hostler was tyin&rsquo; the traps, &ldquo;to-night would
      be a great accommodation, if it was the same to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do better,&rdquo; says one of the others, &ldquo;than step up to the
      ball-room. There&rsquo;s good light still, and the room&rsquo;s long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Be gogstay! Dick Macnamara closed with the offer like a man. I was sent
      for the pistols, and the gentlemen called for a bottle of sherry. You see,
      in case of accident, it would come well before a jury that they drank each
      other&rsquo;s healths, and fought in perfect friendship, for that would benefit
      the survivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slipped into the ball-room, and every body thought the thing was
      settled, they were so quiet and civil with each other as they went up
      stairs. The pistols were charged&mdash;&ldquo;An&rsquo; now,&rdquo; says Callaghan, &ldquo;for the
      last time, I ask ye, will ye have my sister Sophy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, don&rsquo;t lose the light in talkin&rsquo;&mdash;ye have my answer already,&rdquo;
       says Dick Macnamara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they were placed in the corners of the room, and a man with a red
      nose asked, &ldquo;if they were ready?&rdquo; Both said, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; says he. Slap off went both pistols like the clapping of a hand,
      and down dropped Mr. Callaghan with a ball clane into his calf.&mdash;Well,
      every body ran to lift him, when, suddenly, the cry of murder was raised
      from the other end of the room, and out dashed a man in a shirt and
      scarlet night-cap, and a fat woman close at his heels, just as they had
      tumbled out of bed.

      &ldquo;Oh, Holy Moses!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Save our lives! Murder! Murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with ye, honest man?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us time for repentince!&rdquo; says she, droppin&rsquo; on her knees. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      dalers in soft goods, and obliged to tell lies in the way of bisnis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for a dacent young woman to come before company in
      that way!&mdash;Arrah, put the petticoat on ye at least.&rdquo; Troth, it was no
      wonder the cratures were scared.&mdash;Ye see, there was a closet off the
      ball-room, divided with a wooden partition; and as the house was full, and
      the travellers tired, they stuck them into it for the night. Divil a one
      of us, in the hurry, thought of lookin&rsquo; in; and when the man woke with the
      noise, and sate up to listen what the matter was, the fellow with the red
      nose cried &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and Callaghan&rsquo;s ball pops through the partition, and
      whips the tassel off the daler&rsquo;s night-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, for fear of any fresh shindy, I got the luggage tied upon the shay,
      Dick shook hands with Callaghan, and sent his compliments to his sister
      Sophy,&mdash;and away we drove to Moate; and the next evening got safe to
      Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the jobs ever a man undertook, the sorest was to look after Dick
      Macnamara. Ye might as well herd a basketful of black-beetles, as keep him
      in sight: and the two days we stopped in Dublin, though I watched him like
      a bailiff, he got into two fights&mdash;rid of thirty pounds&mdash;and
      snug into the watchouse afterwards. &lsquo;Pon my soul, my heart was fairly
      broke with him. When we landed at Holyhead, and were fairly out of
      Irelan&rsquo;, says I to myself, &ldquo;Maybe we may come some speed now;&rdquo; but <i>Mona-sin-dhiaoul</i>!&mdash;our
      troubles were only beginnin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Troth, at one time, I thought we would never have reached London at all:
      and as it was, we were three weeks upon the road. We never stopped for the
      night, but Dick discovered some divil to detain us. One while he would be
      in love with the mistress, and at another, dyin&rsquo; about the maid&mdash;and
      all of them he swore upon the book to marry on his return. We came to
      England to look for one woman&mdash;an&rsquo; if he had but kept his word, we
      would have gone back with one and twenty; but as matters turned out, the
      divil a wife we brought home at all at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he would be philandrin&rsquo; at the inns, I was makin&rsquo; inquiries for a
      lady that would fit us; and though I heard tell of three as we came along,
      the divil an eye, let alone a finger, Dick Maenamara iver could get on
      ather of them&mdash;for we had always the worst of luck. The first we
      tried was the daughter of a squire, and as we were crossin&rsquo; the fence to
      get into the pleasure-ground, that I heard she generally walked in, we
      were spied by a keeper on the watch, and taken for poachers he had chased
      before, and, only that his gun missed fire, we would have been murdered on
      the spot. We made an offer at a widdo&rsquo;, but Dick managed to slip into a
      steel trap, and nearly lost his leg. Another trial was at a ward of
      Chaneery, and we were hardly in the domain, till we were handed over by
      her guardian to the beadles. They swore we were rogues and vagabonds, and
      clapt us into the stocks for the evening, and give us a free lodgin&rsquo; the
      same night in a place they called the cage. At last we managed to get up
      to London, Dick with one skirt only to his coat, as he had lost the other
      in a skrimmage with a constable; and a rap more than three guineas and a
      half, we hadn&rsquo;t between us to bless ourselves on! Nobody could tell how
      the rest of the ould ladies&rsquo; hundred went, but Dick Maenamara and the
      divil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the first thing we did was to look after our luggage, which we
      found; and the next to inquire if there was a letter from Connemara at the
      post-office, and sure enough there was, and every soul in Killcrogher
      seemed to have had a hand in it. Sir Thomas said that he was as well
      pleased that Callaghan wasn&rsquo;t kilt; but the shot grieved him, it was so
      low; and he begged Dick in future, to take his man as near about the
      waistband of the breeches as he could. He said that the attorneys, bad
      luck to them! were tormentin&rsquo; him as usual; and as he never opened a
      letter now, except he knew what it was about, he tould Dick when he wrote
      home, to put a cross upon the corner. Lady Mae, as we used to call her for
      shortness, wished to know when she was to expect her daughter-in-law. Mary
      Regan was afeard she couldn&rsquo;t stay much longer in her place&mdash;and the
      priest stuck to the ould tune of the <i>Ara-gud-neeish</i>. He tould Dick
      to be as quick as he could; and if there was like to be any delay, to send
      over a part of the fortune, as they were greatly shuck for money. Wer&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      we in a nate pickle&mdash;not worth five pound in the world, and the
      people at home expecting thousands by return of post!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we had takin a lodgin&rsquo; near the Seven Dials; it was chape, that was
      one reason; and one likes to get as near Christians as they can, and that
      was another. I walked out, not well knowin&rsquo; what to do; and before I
      crossed the second street, who should I drop upon, promiscuisly, but Biddy
      Hagan, with a basket on her arm. She had bin dairy-maid at Killcrogher,
      and ran off with a corplar that was recruitin&rsquo; there ten years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Biddy,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is this you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who else should it be?&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;maybe ye would oblige us with your
      own name, young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Di ye remember Shemus McGreal?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Shemus, the whipper, at Killcrogher?&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same; and here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she blessed herself&mdash;&ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but ye&rsquo;re
      grown! Arrah, step in, an&rsquo; for ould times we&rsquo;ll have a flash of
      lightnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In we turns into the sign of St. Patrick, and calls for half-a-pint. I
      tould her all the news, and all about what had brought us from the ould
      country over here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Shemus,&rdquo; says Biddy, &ldquo;myself would travel ten mile to sarve a dog
      that was iver at Killcrogher&mdash;and ye have made no speed? Och, hone,
      an&rsquo; more&rsquo;s the pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I ups and tells her the rason we were fairly batin&rsquo;&mdash;all because
      we couldn&rsquo;t find out an heiress, good nor bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, saver of the bog!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;if ye&rsquo;es only had the luck to have
      fallen into company with Miss Figgins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Miss Figgins?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only child of ould Figgins of Puddin&rsquo; Lane, the richest grocer
      in the city, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a big word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Brideeine, <i>avourneeine!</i>&mdash;is there any way we could
      come across her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, the divil a one of me can tell,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me that carries
      home the markittin&rsquo;, and the kitchen maid&rsquo;s a Cork woman, born in
      Cloonakitty&mdash;and we&rsquo;re as thick as mustard. Be the Lord!&rdquo; says she,
      &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bring ye together in the twinklin&rsquo; of a bed-post, if ye&rsquo;ll just
      sit where ye are. Have an eye to the basket, for the house isn&rsquo;t ovir
      onist, if there ar&rsquo;nt liars in the world;&rdquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; away cut Biddy Hagan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wasn&rsquo;t more than ten minutes, till back she comes with Oney Donovan.
      We called another half-pint, and drank to better acquaintance. &ldquo;Oney,&rdquo;
       says she, &ldquo;<i>astore!</i> tell us all about ould Figgins&rsquo; daughter, if you
      please, for this gentleman&rsquo;s master has come ovir for a wife. The Lord
      speed him to get the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, then I&rsquo;m sorry to say,&rdquo; says Oney, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be no dalin&rsquo; in our
      house, for Miss Sophiar&rsquo;s to be married a Friday mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, murder!&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A murder it is,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;thirty thousan&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to a divil ye wouldn&rsquo;t
      kick out of a petatay garden, because he&rsquo;s rich as a Jew, and rides in a
      sheriff&rsquo;s carrige.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wasn&rsquo;t this too bad? The very woman that would have fitted us to a T!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were all sorely cast down at it; so we called another pint&mdash;and
      we couldn&rsquo;t do less, as we were in trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be gogstay!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t we run away with her? This is but Munday;
      and if the time&rsquo;s short, we must only be the handier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, blood&rsquo;s thicker than water! and Brideeine, Oney, and myself settled
      all before we parted. Ach of them was to be settled at Killcrogher for
      life&mdash;and, after a throw at the counter, we parted till next mornin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lost half the evenin&rsquo; in makin&rsquo; out Dick Macnamara. He was the
      unluckiest member iver any body was consarned with. The time was short&mdash;every
      moment worth goold&mdash;and when he should have been in the way (I&rsquo;ll not
      bid bad luck to him, as he&rsquo;s dead), where the divil should I hoak him out,
      after tatterin&rsquo; over half the town, but in a back attic in a blind alley,
      where he was drinking taa wid a stay-maker?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, short as the time was, we got all ready for the marriage; and the
      devil a one of Miss Figgins&rsquo;s dramed the trouble we were takin&rsquo; to get her
      settled. She was what they call a Methodist, and went regularly to chapel,
      and she thought she was to receive the blessin&rsquo; of the clargy on Friday
      morning at some church&mdash;and we thought it better to marry her on the
      Wednesday night before it, and save both ceremony and expense; and, only
      for himself, the stupid fool! Miss Figgins would have been Dick
      Macnamara&rsquo;s wife, as sure as the hearth money.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no trouble in life to get plenty of help in St. Giles&rsquo;&mdash;and
      Oney Donovan laid Dick Macnamara in a loft that looked into the grocer&rsquo;s
      breakfast-parlour, from which he could see Miss Figgins, and make himself
      acquaint with her fatures and her clothes. All was fixed for watchin&rsquo; her
      from the chapel&mdash;and at the corner of a quiet street, through which
      she had to go to her own house, a chay, with a trusty driver, was to be
      ready to whip her off. Dick Macnamara was to be quietly sittin&rsquo; inside.
      When she was passin&rsquo;, the boys were to lift her in, and away we were to
      drive like lightnin&rsquo; to a lonely house five mile out of town, where a
      couple-beggar was ready to tie the knot. Sorra nater planned thing could
      be&mdash;but the divil a plan was iver formed in this world, that Dick
      Macnamara wouldn&rsquo;t make ducks and drakes of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now that every thing was fixed, we thought it would be better to
      write home, to keep all quiet in Killcrogher; and Dick took up the pen,
      though he would as soon have swallowed poison. In the letter, we tould Sir
      Thomas how we were gettin&rsquo; on since we came to London, and showed him that
      we were in a fair way, ather &ldquo;to make a spoon or spoil a horn,&rdquo; as they
      say in Connaught; and we begged him to keep his heart up, and the gates
      closed, till he heard from us again. We requested Father Pat to stick to
      the ould gentleman, and not let him think upon the law but as little as he
      could. Dick sent his love to Mary Regan, and I my humble duty to the
      ladies. Sorra word we mentioned, good or bad, of our puttin&rsquo; in an evenin&rsquo; 
      in the stocks. We also tould them a big lie, the Lord pardon us! and that
      was, that we heard mass reglar, although the devil a ather of us had
      listened to a single we, since we blessed ourselves the Sunday before we
      left home, in the chapel of Killcrogher. No wonder, in troth, that such a
      pair of hathens should have the worst of luck, for sure we desarved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday came, and all was ready for the venture. The women stuck to us
      like brieks; and Oney brought the news, that for sartin Miss Figgins would
      attend the chapel that evening, for there was a grate pracher to hould
      forth. At proper time, the postehay was in the street, and Dick skrulged
      up in the corner of it. Three fine strappin&rsquo; boys from St. Giles&rsquo;s (all
      first-cousins of Biddy Donovan&rsquo;s) and myself, took our sate in the front
      windy of a porter-house, and Oney kept watch at the corner, to give us the
      word when her mistress would appear. Be gogstay! we had only called the
      seeond pint before Oney cuts by the windy, with the news that the flock
      were comin&rsquo; out, and the woman we wanted would be with us in less than a
      pig&rsquo;s whisper; an&rsquo; away she pelted home, to be safe in the house,&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      then ye know, of coorse, she would never be suspeeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up jumps the boys: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo; says I, turning down a cropper, in which
      they joined me. We then claps on our caubeens, and slips out of the door,&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      sure enough, at the bottom of the street we sees two ladies comin&rsquo; forid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the woman?&rdquo; says I to Dick, who was peepin&rsquo; from the wee windy
      in the baek of the shay. &ldquo;Her in the blue bonnet,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egad, I was rather surprised at the appearance of the woman that Dick
      Macnamara pointed out to us. To do her justice, she was good-lookin&rsquo; 
      enough&mdash;but, faith, she was no chicken&mdash;and nather in dress nor
      action what ye would expect from a reglar heiress, and, as Oney said, the
      biggest grocer in the city. I remembered that they said she was a
      Methodist&mdash;and, thinks I, maybe that&rsquo;s the rason she goes so plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I gives the word to Biddy Donovan&rsquo;s cousins, in a whisper, and in
      Irish. Divil a handier boys iver assisted in a job of the kind,&mdash;they
      lifts her off the pavement in a twinklin&rsquo;; and, before ye could say Jack
      Robinson, she was fairly sated beside Dick Macnamara, with a handkerchief
      stuck into her mouth, to keep down the squallin&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoogh! off we starts&mdash;and I threw my eye over my shoulder as I was
      sittin&rsquo; by the driver&mdash;Miss Figgins was kickin&rsquo; like the divil&mdash;-but
      as Dick had a fast hould of her, we didn&rsquo;t mind that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; says Tony Braddigin&mdash;that was the postboy&rsquo;s name&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      it eligint, Shemus, jewel?&rdquo; says he. In troth, there never was anything
      better managed; for we heard afterwards that not a mortal saw anything
      that passed, but an ould Charley,&mdash;an&rsquo; as the Carneys ran past him&mdash;they
      were, ye know, Biddy Donovan&rsquo;s cousins, by the mother&rsquo;s side&mdash;one of
      them gave him the fist; an&rsquo;, for a fortnight afterwards, he couldn&rsquo;t tell
      light from darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by this time we were clear of the town, and it was nearly twilight.
      I turned round now that we were safe, to see how matters were gettin&rsquo; on
      within, and if Dick was makin&rsquo; love to her. Well, I put the question to
      him in Irish, and he answered in the same:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De ye think,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not workin&rsquo; for the best&mdash;but wheniver,
      to make lier asy, I tell her we&rsquo;ll marry out of the face, by Jakers! she
      kicks the harder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra soul&rsquo;s within bearin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says I&mdash;&ldquo;so take the handkerchief out
      of her mouth and give her air&mdash;for maybe she&rsquo;s chokin&rsquo;&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s what makes her kick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did what I bid him&mdash;and, Lord! what a tongue she had when she got
      the use of it!&mdash;and not a word for ather of us but <i>thief and
      villain</i>. I disremember how she swore; but if she had been born in
      Connaught, the oaths couldn&rsquo;t have come asier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye etarnal robbers!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;what do ye want? I have no money about
      me, and I suppose I&rsquo;m to be murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want nothing in the world,&rdquo; says Dick, &ldquo;but to make ye an honest woman
      manin&rsquo;, of course, to marry her lawfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me an honest woman!&mdash;why, ye common thieves, what do ye mane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick made a kind of a confused story of it, but she didn&rsquo;t wait to the
      end. &ldquo;Oh, murder! murder!&rdquo; she called out&mdash;&ldquo;Marry me! and get me
      transported?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transported?&rdquo; says Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I would,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;marryin&rsquo; you, and my own lawful husband
      alive! Arrah, Sam Singlestich, dear!&mdash;little did I think, when I made
      taa for ye this evenin&rsquo;, that I would be bundled off by these villains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Mister Singlestich?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? ye thief of the world! but my lawful husband! Oh, bad luck attend
      ye, night and day!&mdash;ye have the gallows in ye&rsquo;re face,&rdquo; says she,
      lookin&rsquo; full at me, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s one comfort, if I live to escape, I&rsquo;ll hear
      the Judge tellin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;r fortune at the Ould Baily. Troth, and I&rsquo;ll go to
      see ye hanged, too, even if it cost me five shillins for an opposite
      windy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah,&rdquo; says the postilion, turnin&rsquo; sharp round at the word &lsquo;Ould Baily,&rsquo; 
      and &lsquo;being hanged,&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest woman,&rdquo; says I (for Dick seemed stupified) &ldquo;who the divil are ye?&mdash;Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      ye Miss Figgins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss?&mdash;yer mother!&rdquo; says she;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the wife of a dacent
      tradesman, and the lawful mother of five children an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show them again
      any within a mile of Huggin Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the postboy, jumpin&rsquo; out of the saddle&mdash;&ldquo;by the powers of
      pewter! we&rsquo;re all dead men!&rdquo; and, at one spring, he clears the fence, and
      cuts over hedge and ditch like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says I to myself, &ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to sit here and be hanged?&rdquo;&mdash;and
      down I hops too. Dick Macnamara seemed to be of the same opinion, for he
      was on the road already. We takes the country out of the face, as if we
      were matched for a hundred&mdash;lavin&rsquo; the tailor&rsquo;s wife and the two
      post-horses&mdash;the one to look after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every body that iver rode to a fox-hound, knows that it&rsquo;s the pace that
      kills; and, for two miles, Dick and I crossed the country neck and neck,
      takin&rsquo; every thing <i>in stroke</i> as the Lord sent it. No wonder, when
      we came to a cross-road, that both were dead baten, and that Dick called
      out, for the love of God, to stop for a minute or two that we might get
      second wind for a fresh start. Down we sate upon the ditch; and when I got
      breath enough, I began to abuse Dick Macnamara like a pickpocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what sins have I committed, that I&rsquo;m to be ruinated
      through you? If iver the divil had a fast hould of a sinner, it&rsquo;s
      yourself, Dick! Was there iver a man so asily put in the ready way to make
      a fortune? Wasn&rsquo;t the lady med out&mdash;the rough work done&mdash;and
      sorra thing for you to do, but sit like a gintleman quietly in the chaise,
      pay year lady some tender attention, and keep her mouth stuffed with a
      pocket-handkerchif. And how beautiful ye put your fut in it! Oh, Holy
      Joseph!&mdash;to run away with a tradesman&rsquo;s-wife, and the mother of five
      childer into the bargain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began mutterin&rsquo; something about a mistake, and talked about blue
      bonnets and yalla ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; says I, interruptin&rsquo; him. &ldquo;Arrah, have done wid yer
      balderdash an&rsquo; yer bonnets;&mdash;havn&rsquo;t ye made a pretty <i>gommoque</i>
      * of yerself? Where are we to head to? and how are we to chate the
      gallows? Blessed Bridget!&mdash;to be hanged in the flower of my youth,
      for runnin&rsquo; away with the mother of a family!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglice&mdash;an idiot.
</pre>
    <p>
      Before I had done spakin&rsquo;, we hears a carriage cornin&rsquo; up at splittin&rsquo; 
      speed. We ducked into the ditch to let it pass&mdash;and at one look I
      knew it to be the very chay we had brought with us on our unfortunit
      expedition. The horses had run off; and as they passed us at a gallop, we
      heard the tailor&rsquo;s wife shoutin&rsquo; a thousand murders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah! what&rsquo;s to be done at all at all,&rdquo; says I, as the carriage cantered
      on. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the ghost of a rap about me. What money have you, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five or six shillins,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to pay the turnpikes, and a light guinea
      for the marriage money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then, ye won&rsquo;t require it, Dick, <i>avourneeine</i>,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Any
      little job in future ye want from the clargy, they&rsquo;ll trate ye to it for
      nothin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a comfort when a man comes to the gallows, that he&rsquo;s
      provided with a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what need I bother ye with all the misfortune that kem over us? Half
      the time we lay out in barns, or under hay-stacks; for if we ventured into
      the parlour of a publie-house, the divil a thing ye would hear talked of
      but the attempt upon the tailor&rsquo;s wife&mdash;with a reward of fifty pound
      for the intended murderers, and a description of their persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we were fairly worn out with hunger and fatigue, without a shoe to
      our feet, or a <i>scurrick</i> in our pockets, and nothing was left for us
      but to list. Accordingly, we joined the first party that we met, and the
      sergeant gave us plinty of entertainment, and two pound a man. We were to
      be attested the next mornin&rsquo;; but as he didn&rsquo;t like our looks, he put us
      in the room where the corplar slept, and took care to lock the door
      carefully behind him. I guessed as much, and, feaks, I determined the
      divil another yard we would keep company, if I could help it; and maybe I
      didn&rsquo;t succeed? When we were locked in, I produces a bottle of rum, and
      the corplar&mdash;who was a drunken divil&mdash;and I finished it by
      moonlight, hand to fist. I lifts him into bed blind drunk; and when the
      house was quiet, I wakens Dick Mac-namara, and we opened the windy fair
      and asy, and lowered ourselves by the blankets to the ground. We travelled
      night an&rsquo; day&mdash;exchanged our clothes for stable-jackets&mdash;and at
      last, we had the luck to be taken into the yard of an inn, and there get
      employment as helpers&mdash;and when at Killcrogher they thought we were
      travellin&rsquo; homeward in our own coach, it&rsquo;s most likely we were grazing the
      wheels of his chay for some travellin&rsquo; bagman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Dick was wispin&rsquo; a horse&mdash;and the only two things in this world
      he could do dacently was to warm one after a fox, and wisp him dry
      afterwards&mdash;when in comes one of a recruitin&rsquo; party to ask some
      question about his officer. When he went away I says to Dick in Irish:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The divil welcome the last visitor. Wheniver I see a bunch of ribbons in
      a sodger&rsquo;s cap, I always get a start, and think that it&rsquo;s one of the lads
      we listed with, that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to look after his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks! an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not overly asy in their company ather,&rdquo; says Dick back to
      me&mdash;and him and I continues talkin&rsquo; and laughin&rsquo; at how stupid the
      corplar looked in the mornin&rsquo;, when he found an open windy and an empty
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; says a voice at our elbow, &ldquo;ye gave his majesty leg-bail, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We gave a start, and looked round, and who was standin&rsquo; close to us but
      a-little dark-visaged gentleman, with a twist in the eyes that didn&rsquo;t
      improve him much&mdash;and by the whole look of him, the very last man you
      would meet in a day&rsquo;s walk, that ye would borrow money to spend in company
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      You maybe sure that Dick and I were scared enough. &ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;we
      are ketched at last, and this dark divil will split upon us&mdash;and then
      the first march will be to the black-hole for desarchin&rsquo;; and the second,
      to the gallows, for the murder of a tailor&rsquo;s wife, only that we didn&rsquo;t
      kill her. Well, I struv to put it off as a joke, but the wee black fellow
      was too deep for it and he spoke the best of Irish too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Badershin!</i>&rdquo; says he, with a wink of one of his quare eyes, &ldquo;<i>Tig-gum
      tigue Tiggeeine!</i> * It won&rsquo;t do, boys, I&rsquo;m not in the recruitin&rsquo; line,
      so ye needn&rsquo;t be afeerd of me. But, as ye have been on the tramp, in the
      coorse of yer rambles did ye happen to hear anything about Sir Richard
      Macnamara?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Be the powers of pewter! the question made its start.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *   These terms being rendered into common English, mean&mdash;
     &ldquo;Be quiet&mdash;you can&rsquo;t humbug me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;but if you had inquired after ould Sir Thomas, I could
      have given ye a better answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Sir Thomas?&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what other, but Sir Thomas of Killcrogher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a such a man lives there,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nabochish!</i>&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;maybe I wasn&rsquo;t bred and born under him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Sir Riehard I want to see. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      give a <i>traneeine</i> to be in company with Sir Thomas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be cheek-be-jowl with the
      ould gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil have the liars!&rdquo; says the wee fellow in return; &ldquo;for if ye had y&rsquo;er
      wish, ye would have a ton weight of lime and mortar on the top of ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christ stan&rsquo; between us and evil!&rdquo; says I, crossin&rsquo; myself. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mane that he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith an&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; says the wee black fellow, &ldquo;they have takin&rsquo; a
      great liberty with him, for they buried him in Killeroglier on Tuesday
      week&mdash;and I have been tatterin&rsquo; over half England in search of his
      son. Be the Lord!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;ye might as well grip hould of a Banshee. *
      For all the tidings I could get of him was, that a ruffin, called <i>Shemus
      Rhua</i>, ran off with a tailor&rsquo;s wife; and he, the villin, persuaded the
      good-natured young gentleman to follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Banshee is a spirit attached to old Irish families,
     who foretells deaths and other calamities by melancholy
     wailings before they occur. He is never seen.
</pre>
    <p>
      Well, who should the little man be but a lawyer sent in pursuit of Dick;
      and, without delay, we set off for home; and, when we got there, said as
      little about England as we could. It was supposed that Sir Richard might
      have cleared Killeroglier if he had taken the right way; but he set up a
      pack of fox-hounds, and married a dashin&rsquo; lady because that she could ride
      to them to fortune. A few years settled the busnis&mdash;and what Sir
      Thomas had begun Sir Riehard cliverly complated. The dogs were sent
      adrift, the horses canted by the sheriff, my lady boulted with a light
      dragoon, and, to finish all, one wet mornin&rsquo;, poor Dick was brought home
      upon a door, dead as a herrin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s not one stone standin&rsquo; on the
      other at Killerogher; and of one of the ouldest and the best estates
      within the province, there&rsquo;s not a sod of it now in possession of a man of
      the name of Maenamara.

      profitable reminiscences of burglary and abduction, Shemus Rhua
      entertained the fosterer on the road, until the worthy twain accomplished
      their journey in perfect safety, and ensconced themselves, as we mentioned
      before, in that safe and salubrious section of the Modern Babylon,
      supposed to be under the immediate protection of St. Patrick, and the
      especial <i>surveillance</i> of the police, vulgarly ycleped the Seven
      Dials. There we shall leave them to recover from the fatigues incident to
      a migration, <i>au pied</i>, from &ldquo;the far west,&rdquo; until, like giants
      refreshed, they should find themselves ready for a fresh start upon the
      world, to try, as the rat-catcher philosophically remarked, &ldquo;their
      fortunes&mdash;any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I need scarcely say that I availed myself of Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s permission, and
      early in the forenoon presented myself at his hotel. As I had expected, he
      was from home; but Dominique conducted me to the presence of his young
      mistress; and, to judge from the kindness of my welcome, the visit was not
      disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when Mr. Hartley returned to dinner; and after the cloth had
      been removed, and Isidora had retired, he resumed a subject that he had
      casually mentioned to me before, namely, how far it would be prudent or
      possible to place myself in the presence of my grandfather, and try what
      impression my unexpected appearance might produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made secret inquiries,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;respecting Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s
      habits, to find out how an interview could be achieved, but I have failed
      in obtaining any information but what is vague and unsatisfactory; but, as
      Clifford Hall is only twenty miles from town, you shall run down, Hector,
      and try whether fortune may not do more for you than I can. The domain
      adjoins the village of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. There you will
      find a rustic inn; and there, also, you may probably glean some
      information that may direct your course of action afterwards. Thither, at
      present, it would be imprudent in me to venture; but you are unknown, and
      consequently you may venture safely. You will find your grand-sire under
      the double thrall of his steward and his Confessor. I shall sketch both
      for you.

      &ldquo;The former was born in the house, and reared and educated from charitable
      motives by the old gentleman, from his having become an orphan while an
      infant. Gradually, he rose from dependency to affluence; in time he
      managed the old man&rsquo;s income; and report says, that he has secured a
      goodly fortune from the pilferings of the estate. It was whispered that he
      had secretly encouraged Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s discarded boy in his wild and
      profligate career; and that, by the suppression of letters and numerous
      acts of villany beside, he contrived to snap the last link of natural
      affection between an angry father and a guilty son. Certainly, in the hour
      of young Clifford&rsquo;s disgrace and destitution, he evinced the blackest
      ingratitude to one who, badly as he might have behaved to others, had
      showered favours on him when a boy, and trusted him afterwards with
      unlimited confidence. Such is Morley the steward; and now we will briefly
      sketch Daniels the confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Jesuit; born, I believe, in England, but educated abroad; a deep
      designing zealot&mdash;bigoted to his own faith, and intolerant to all
      besides. The great object of his existence is to aggrandize the order he
      belongs to; and by the exercise of monastic influence on a mind always
      superstitious, and now imbecile from age, he trusts to alienate from
      natural heirs the noble estates of that weak old man, to whom he has
      become a ghostly counsellor. In short, Morley and Daniels act with a unity
      of purpose, but different end: the one, to build a fortune for himself;
      the other, to gratify a monk&rsquo;s ambition, and raise himself to a commanding
      position in that order which he intends to aggrandize at the expense of
      your mother and yourself. You can easily understand that every obstacle
      will be placed in your way by individuals so deeply interested in
      preventing the old man from being reconciled to a child he once was so
      devotedly attached to; and whether you succeed or fail, matters cannot be
      more unpromising than they are. They say the fortunes of an Irishman carry
      him, at times, through difficulties which to other mortals would prove
      insuperable. Try yours, Hector&mdash;something may be gained&mdash;and,
      need I tell you?&mdash;nothing can be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s advice, and started next evening by a stage coach
      that passed the village he had named; and at dusk I alighted at a clean
      and comfortable public-house, intituled the Fox and Hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was sharp, and, as I had travelled outside, an introduction to
      a snug parlour and sparkling wood-fire was agreeable. I ordered supper and
      a bed; and, while the former was being prepared, considered in what
      manner, and by what means, I should endeavour to obtain an interview with
      Mr. Clifford. Mr. Hartley had recommended me to glean some intelligence
      from the landlord, should I find him inclined to be communicative; and,
      when the cloth had been removed and a correct assortment of fluids was
      placed upon the table, I desired &ldquo;mine host&rdquo; to be summoned to the
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he appeared, I had no difficulty to ascertain at a glance that he had
      pursued in earlier life the honourable trade of arms, and, like myself,
      had been intended to supply &ldquo;food for powder.&rdquo; He was a tall, hale,
      hearty-looking veteran, and stout for his years, albeit Father Time had
      silvered his head and stooped his shoulders. Still maintaining that
      feeling of deference when in the presence of a superior, which military
      usage renders habitual, he drew himself up at the foot of the table, and
      respectfully inquired &ldquo;what my honour wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my worthy host, but your company for half an hour. The evenings
      grow long, and I hate &lsquo;to drink one hand against the other,&rsquo; as we say in
      Ireland. If I guess right, you have retired from a profession on which I
      have but entered recently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; returned he of the Fox and Hounds;&mdash;&ldquo;I wore the king&rsquo;s
      livery for fifteen years; and, God bless him, now that I have done my
      work, he allows me two-and-eightpence a-day to enable me to drink his
      health in comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem, when you bade Brown-Bess good-bye, to have taken up comfortable
      quarters here, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, thank God, not only comfortable, but in garrison I hope for life.
      When I returned home, I married the sergeant-major&rsquo;s widow. Well, we each
      had laid by a bit of money&mdash;put it together&mdash;took this house&mdash;and
      after being five years keeping the business going on, things have gone
      straight enough with us, and we are better by the half than when we
      entered it. I wish every worn-out soldier had as snug cantonments for old
      age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you served abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began in Holland with the Duke of York, and I finished in Spain with
      poor Sir John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What regiments did you serve in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never but in one, the old steady fifty &mdash;th. Under its honoured
      colours I stood my last field, at Corunna, and fought my first one at
      Malines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in the grenadiers; do you remember who commanded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As stout a soldier as ever took a company into fire&mdash;Colonel
      O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you fought under my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The retired soldier put down the glass he was lifting to his lips, and for
      a moment scanned my features eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&mdash;the living image of the kindest and bravest officer
      under whom a soldier ever served! I am prouder, sir, in having you this
      night beneath my humble roof, than if you called a prince your father.&rdquo;
       And stretching forward his hand, the veteran grasped mine in his with an
      honest ardour that proved how deeply military attachment takes root, and
      how dearly the remembrance of &ldquo;auld lang syne&rdquo; is cherished in the
      soldier&rsquo;s memory. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is there in the Fox and Hounds
      which I can offer to my old colonel&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but what is already on the table; but possibly you could, in
      another matter, render me some assistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name but the way in which John Williams can be serviceable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my relationship to Mr. Clifford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. I was with my gallant captain the night we stole his beautiful
      lady from the convent garden. Alas! many a time it has grieved me to the
      heart, to think that the old gentleman should remain so cold and
      unforgiving as he is; but he is poisoned against his child by the priests
      and villains who surround him. How can I be useful? What do you intend to
      do?&mdash;Do you intend to call on the old man? If you do, I fear there
      are those about him who will prevent it. No one is allowed to see him but
      in the presence of that dark monk they call Father Daniels. The house is
      guarded like a gaol, and the gates are locked against the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I despair of obtaining an interview by open means,&rdquo; I replied&mdash;&ldquo;How
      shall I manage it by secret ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all but impossible,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;I will think over it
      to-night; and if a chance exist we&rsquo;ll try it, hit or miss. But soft!&mdash;surely
      that voice which I hear in the kitchen is old George Smith the keeper&rsquo;s?
      He is the only one of the old servants now remaining at the Hall; and,
      only that his master has a strong regard for him, and won&rsquo;t listen to any
      stories to his disadvantage, he would have shared the fate of others, and
      been sent adrift as they were. Father Daniels hates him; and, faith, its
      cordially returned! The old keeper remembers your honour&rsquo;s mother well,
      and many a time he speaks of her&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll stake my pension, that he
      will befriend the son of her whom he still reverences in his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the sergeant rose and left the room.&mdash;Irishmen are all
      more or less superstitious; and I hailed it as a happy omen, that, in the
      very opening of my attempt, fate should have thrown across me an old
      comrade of my father. To succeed, I had scarce a hope; but, for every
      reason, I was ambitious to fail respectably. I was experimentalizing under
      the direction of one whose good opinion I was anxious to secure; and I
      determined that when I returned to town, I would at least satisfy Mr.
      Hartley that I had struck boldly, although the blow had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes the host returned, followed by an elderly man. The latter
      made me a dutiful obeisance; but when approaching the table, and the light
      fell strongly on my face, under a sudden impulse he caught my hand,
      pressed it to his lips, and seemed to be powerfully affected. The likeness
      to my mother at once established my identity; and in a few minutes, if by
      the agency of George Smith I could have been placed in that house to which
      I wus natural heir, it would have been instantly effected. A half-hour&rsquo;s
      conversation determined our course of operations, and I learned enough
      regarding my grandfather&rsquo;s habits to convince me, that, with good luck,
      the interview I desired might be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that in good weather, there was a favourite seat in a
      sheltered corner of the park, to which Mr. Clifford generally repaired.
      There he would sometimes remain an hour, while the Confessor walked
      backwards and forwards reading the daily office which the rules of his
      order imposed. Occasionally, Mr. Clifford employed himself with some
      devotional book; and all intrusions on the part of servants were rigidly
      prohibited. From strangers none could be apprehended, as none were allowed
      to pass the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a thick clump immediately adjacent to the bench where Mr. Clifford
      rested, it was arranged that I should lie <i>perdu</i>, and if fortune
      offered the opportunity, I was to sally from my ambuscade, and seize it.
      The keeper was to assist me to scale the wall, and point out the place
      where I could best conceal myself&mdash;and, to the blind goddess of the
      wheel, the rest was properly committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not wherefore, but that night I went to sleep with all the buoyancy
      of hope, although I had no reason to think that chances wild as mine could
      prove successful. In my dreams, however, results were fortunate&mdash;every
      obstacle was overcome&mdash;I was reconciled to Mr. Clifford; and, better
      still, united to Isidora.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast old George announced himself, and the weather was
      propitious. It was one of those fine autumnal mornings which promise a hot
      noon and a frosty evening. From an angle of the park wall, the lower bough
      of a large beech tree extended itself. It was not ten feet above the
      ground, and, by throwing a rope across, it required but small exertion to
      gain it; and that done, the entrance to the park was easy. Inside, the
      gamekeeper was to await my advent. The host furnished me with what is not
      generally an acceptable present; but the halter&mdash;for it was one&mdash;well
      nigh proved the ladder to my fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed time I made the attempt, and succeeded; and, stealing
      along the shrubbery, gained the clump, and took a safe position behind a
      thick holly, not six yards distant from the seat which the keeper pointed
      out as the one generally occupied by Mr. Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      All proceeded as I expected and had hoped&mdash;and the mildness of the
      day induced the old gentleman to take his customary walk. He was attended
      by the Jesuit, on whose arm he leaned; and on reaching his resting-place,
      he received a book from the Confessor, and commenced reading a passage
      which the monk had pointed out. In a few minutes the churchman strolled
      some distance from the bench, and while I was considering the way in which
      I should present myself to the old man without occasioning alarm, to my
      unspeakable satisfaction, I observed a servant approach the Confessor
      hastily, and after a brief communication, they both walked away in the
      direction of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized the golden opportunity, stole from my retreat, and placed myself
      in front of the old gentleman, and, so silently, that he remained with his
      eyes fixed upon the book for more than a minute afterwards. Presently he
      looked up&mdash;he stared at me with evident surprise&mdash;for it was a
      rare occurrence to find himself alone with a stranger&mdash;and in a low
      tone he asked me &ldquo;if I wished to speak with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I advanced another step, knelt at the old man&rsquo;s feet, and gently took his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this?&mdash;Who are you?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son, come hither to solicit pardon for a parent&mdash;your grandchild
      begs your blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! these are Ellen&rsquo;s features! Merciful God!&mdash;Do I rave, or dream?
      Speak, boy&mdash;your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business?&mdash;Quick!&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon for my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, Ellen, Ellen!&rdquo; he feebly muttered; and next moment be fainted in
      my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was dreadfully alarmed. I thought my sudden appearance had operated
      fatally, called loudly for assistance, and on looking around to see
      whether my summons had been heard, observed that the Jesuit, followed by
      several men, was running towards me rapidly. In another minute he was at
      our side; and never, in a human countenance, were anger and astonishment
      so mingled as in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove your master!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the servants. &ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo; he
      continued, bending his shaggy brows over eyes of sinister expression, and
      directing their deadly glare at me. &ldquo;<i>How dare you</i> intrude where
      strangers are excluded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By right of kindred!&rdquo; I thundered in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk&rsquo;s face blanched. &ldquo;Remove your master instantly,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;and eject this man&mdash;by force, if necessary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;the man who tries it may count on broken bones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the monk inquired, haughtily &ldquo;Your name?&mdash;Your
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men who accompanied him hesitated to obey his orders; and still the
      old man reclined with his head upon my breast, while my arm supported him.
      Certainly, of the priest&rsquo;s body-guard none were gentlemen who would
      volunteer a forlorn hope; and, astounded at the bold tone I used to one,
      who at Clifford Hall had exercised a despotic authority, they seemed any
      thing but anxious to bring matters to hostile conclusions. But when I
      announced my name and relationship to their master, they all receded,
      leaving the matter to be settled by the Jesuit and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Confessor, with admirable skill, at once changed his tactics, and
      adopted another course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, to use the mildest term it admits, your visit has been
      imprudent. Mark in the old man&rsquo;s illness the consequences of your
      rashness! Why did you not notice your intention? Could I have induced your
      grandsire to receive you, I would have done so willingly, and thus have
      prevented a shock that may prove&mdash;and I fear it will&mdash;fatal! For
      God&rsquo;s sake, be advised by me. Leave the park, and let your relative
      receive immediate attention. You see the first effect&mdash;would you,
      should he recover the first shock, expose him to a second? When he is well
      enough to write, I pledge my word, you shall receive an instant
      communication. If you persevere, death will inevitably ensue; and how, may
      I ask, will you, forewarned as you are, excuse the rashness, the madness,
      that occasioned it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The specious arguments of the Jesuit prevailed, and I acceded to his
      proposition. I could not tell the cause that overpowered my grandfather&rsquo;s
      feeble strength; nor could I even guess whether it were anger, or an
      outbreaking of revived affection. In my doubts, I agreed to the monk&rsquo;s
      proposal&mdash;saw the old man carried in a chair to the house&mdash;and
      quitted the domain, perfectly unconscious whether my visit had mitigated
      or confirmed his animosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one brief hour that question was put to rest, and a letter, addressed
      to me at the Fox and Hounds, apprised me that my grandfather considered my
      mother an <i>enfant perdu</i>, and that his displeasure was unmitigable!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In a remote apartment of Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s mansion, that evening, two men
      might have been discovered in earnest conversation; one had a countenance
      sallow, cunning, and repulsive; and a figure remarkable for its height and
      irregular proportions; the other was a middle-sized elderly man, with a
      certain air and intelligence that might stamp him a pawnbroker,
      money-dealer, thieves&rsquo; attorney, or any other profession appertaining to
      the &ldquo;wide-awake&rdquo; school. Heed I say the twain were the Confessor and
      house-steward of my grandfather? Both exhibited unequivocal appearances of
      anxiety and annoyance; and though there were wines upon the table, neither
      seemed inclined to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever any thing more unfortunate than this evening&rsquo;s
      occurrence?&rdquo; exclaimed the Jesuit. &ldquo;For months the old man has never been
      left a moment to himself; and one unguarded interval, what mischief has it
      not produced! Another interview&mdash;and all that you and I for years
      have laboured to effect is totally, hopelessly&mdash;-undone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too true,&rdquo; replied the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never make a will now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we not already made one for him?&rdquo; said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head&mdash;&ldquo;That deed, my friend, will never bear the
      light. We stand in a dangerous position; and had not the old man fainted,
      we were ruined. Even now the mischief is not abated&mdash;he talks of
      nothing but his daughter, and raves about the duty of forgiveness which a
      father should extend to an erring child. What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward mused for a minute&mdash;his brows contracted, and a dark
      expression passed across his face. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the intruder must
      be removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit looked at his companion, but spoke not. The look, however, said&mdash;&ldquo;Would
      that it were done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money will effect it,&rdquo; said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit continued silent, and then carelessly observed, &ldquo;I would give a
      thousand pounds this cursed interview had not occurred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, holy father, give as much to prevent a seeond?&rdquo; asked the
      steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough; I shall act promptly now. Hark! A knock at the door! Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a message from Mr. Clifford requiring that the Confessor should
      attend him instantly. Father Daniels rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till I hear what the old man wants.&rdquo; And, so saying, he
      left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not absent long; and when he entered the chamber, he held an open
      letter in his hand. Carefully closing the door, he thus addressed his
      confederate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I not right&mdash;Our position is all but desperate? What think ye
      was the old man&rsquo;s business?&mdash;To desire the son of his repudiated
      daughter to return to-morrow; and to give directions, that I should write
      and order it to be so. Were that to happen, need I name the result?&mdash;all&mdash;all
      lost! Well, I obeyed, and wrote this letter&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he dictated?&mdash;are you mad, holy father?&rdquo; inquired the steward.
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&lsquo;Tis thus worded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rash Boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your mother&rsquo;s misconduct wrung my heart, and your unwarrantable
      intrusion has nearly brought me to the grave. As you dread the malediction
      of an old man&mdash;desist!&mdash;<i>and for ever</i> avoid the presence
      of one who can never look but with abhorrence on the offspring of a guilty
      daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis signed&mdash;ay, and in his own handwriting too&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;John Clifford.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! This will prevent another visit,&rdquo; said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too sanguine, my friend. The young man is daring;&mdash;he may
      make a second effort. If he succeed&mdash;if he gain a second time the
      sight of his grandfather, the tale is told. This fabricated letter may
      prevent the meeting for a while&mdash;but more effectual measures to
      secure mutual safety are indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, holy father,&rdquo; returned the steward;&mdash;&ldquo;money will
      be necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money shall not be wanting,&rdquo; said the Confessor. &ldquo;This note
      procrastinates, but does not avert the crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward nodded his head. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a breathing-time, that shall not be
      thrown away;&mdash;I&rsquo;m off to London immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven speed thee!&rdquo; said the monk; and the hand of God&rsquo;s minister,
      imprecating a blessing, was laid upon a wretch&rsquo;s head whose avowed embassy
      was&mdash;murder!

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To my humble counsellors, the keeper and the sergeant, I communicated what
      we all considered the decided failure of my experiment. I resolved to
      return direct to town&mdash;and a place was booked accordingly in the
      stage. Another passenger accompanied me&mdash;and how different are the
      ends which influence men&rsquo;s actions! I hurried back to town to bask in the
      smiles of my young and artless Isidora. The object of my <i>compagnon du
      voyage</i> was very opposite,&mdash;the gentleman was Mr. Morley; and his
      embassy&mdash;nothing but to accomplish my assassination.

      CHAPTER XX. A MEETING BETWEEN MEN OF BUSINESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What a dickens is the man always whimpering about murder for? If
      business cannot be carried on without it, what would you have a gentleman
      to do?&rdquo; Beggars&rsquo; Opera.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he scene has
      changed; and we must request the gentle reader to accompany us into a
      close dark alley, with no thoroughfare connecting it to the opener streets
      around, save two narrow and crooked passages scarcely three feet wide. The
      houses are high and old-fashioned, and front each other so closely, that
      from roof to roof an active man might spring. Their general appearance
      betokens fear or wretchedness; for, while some of the windows are so
      jealously blinded, as to prevent all chance of <i>espionage</i> from
      without, others are recklessly exposed to the eye of the passenger, as if
      it were intended to display the extent of the dirt and poverty within. The
      large brick dwelling at the bottom of the court is curiously situated. At
      either gable, it opens by a side door into one of the foul dark passages
      we have described; the front is to the court; and the back abuts upon one
      of those small and half-forgotten cemeteries, not larger than a modern
      drawing-room, which may still be seen, studding here and there the more
      ancient portions of that &ldquo;mighty mass of wood, and brick, and mortar,&rdquo;
       ycleped &ldquo;the great metropolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within this dwelling, there was a semblance of opulence that formed a
      striking contrast to the squalid poverty that was perceptible in every
      other building around it. The rooms were crowded with ill-assorted
      furniture, and the walls covered with mirrors and pictures. On the tables
      and mantelpiece, clocks, china, and fancy-ornaments were incongruously
      heaped together; the whole looking liker a broker&rsquo;s store-room than the
      private dwelling of a man in trade. The place was a receptacle for stolen
      property&mdash;or in thieves&rsquo; parlance, the house of &ldquo;a fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a large apartment on the first floor the owner of this singular
      abiding-place was seated. He seemed a man of fifty, and his own appearance
      was as curious as the domicile he inhabited. To judge by the outline of
      his countenance, you would call him an Irishman, while its character and
      expression were decidedly that of a Jew. Indeed nothing could be less
      prepossessing than both; and the look of the man, taken altogether, was
      low, blackguard, and repulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table beside which this ill-favoured gentleman was seated, there
      were lights, glasses, and decanters; a comfortable fire was blazing in the
      hearth, and window-shutters, plated with iron, were carefully secured with
      bolt and bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown, for so the master of the house was named, seemed occupied with
      business of no common interest; and to a letter, which he held open in his
      hand, frequent references were made. His actions were those of a man
      placed in a situation of perilous uncertainty; for he frequently rose from
      his chair and paced the room, muttering to himself disjointed sentences,
      and again returning to the table, to re-peruse an epistle which evidently
      contained matter of deep moment to the reader. Suddenly he rang the bell,
      and its summons was answered by a personage of remarkable exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a hunchback, and so curiously distorted, that he seemed to be
      constructed of nothing but legs and arms. From his appearance you would
      guess him to be fifteen, but his face told you that he was at least five
      years older; and on every line and feature of that sinister countenance
      cunning and knavery were imprinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said the master of the hunchback, &ldquo;who brought Mr. Sloman&rsquo;s
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red-haired man from the City-road, who proved our last <i>alibi</i>
      at the Bailey,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; returned Mr. Brown, again glancing his eyes over the letter, and
      favouring the hunchback with occasional extracts from its contents,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Matter
      of deepest importance,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;not a moment to be lost,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Be with
      you punctually,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Come through the burial-ground at nine.&rsquo; Have you
      unlocked the wicket, Frank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till I had your orders,&rdquo; returned the attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Frank; people can never be too guarded; but Sloman&rsquo;s a safe hand,
      and we have done a good stroke of business together before now. It must be
      plate or jewels;&mdash;and yet I was talking to an old cracksman this very
      evening, and if there had been a smash last night of any consequence he
      would have been safe to know it and tell me. Unlock the wicket, Frank&mdash;and
      then slip over to the Fortune of War, and try if you can get any
      intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback disappeared; and during his absence, Mr. Brown divided his
      attention pretty equally between the contents of Mr. Sloman&rsquo;s epistle and
      those of the decanter at his elbow. In a quarter of an hour, the
      hunchback&rsquo;s key was heard turning in the street-door lock,&mdash;and he
      presently announced, that, having made diligent inquiries from several
      professional gentlemen who were refreshing themselves in the back parlour
      of the Fortune of War, he was then and there assured, that nothing had
      been done the preceding evening but the usual theatrical business&mdash;with
      the exception of a silver coffee-pot, that had been abstracted from a
      west-end hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another quarter of an hour passed&mdash;a church-bell chimed&mdash;nine
      was sounded from the belfry; and, ere the clock ceased striking, steps
      were heard upon the stairs, and &ldquo;the thing of legs and arms&rdquo; announced
      &ldquo;Mr. Sloman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expected visitor was a large, corpulent, clumsy-looking nondescript,
      with a hooked nose, and light complexion, that rendered it impossible to
      decide whether he should be classed as Jew or Gentile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mr. Brown&rsquo;s invitation he took a chair, filled a glass, ventured a
      remark touching the present state of the weather, and ended with an eulogy
      on the wine.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;It should be capital, for it comes directly from the cellar of a noble
      lord, who is considered to be as good a judge of port as any man in
      England,&rdquo;&mdash;said Mr. Brown; &ldquo;his head butler and I do business pretty
      extensively. He&rsquo;s always hard up, his woman is so desperately extravagant;
      for actresses are always expensive cattle, as you know. I have recommended
      him to take a rib; but he can&rsquo;t stand matrimony, he says,&mdash;at the
      west-end, it&rsquo;s reckoned so infernally vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my letter,&rdquo; said Mr. Sloman, with a significant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all alone?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sloman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul in the house, but Frank and the old housekeeper,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined the visitor, &ldquo;let us go slap to business. We have done a
      little in our time, Mr. Brown, and I flatter myself to mutual
      satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown smiled affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every transaction between us,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sloman, &ldquo;safe, honourable,
      and agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last stolen bills were devilish awkward to manage,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Brown, &ldquo;and things became so ticklish, that they were returned to the
      parties for three hundred. Not a rap more&mdash;no&mdash;upon my honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the bill line,&rdquo; observed Mr. Sloman, &ldquo;at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brown. &ldquo;Is it a crack?&mdash;plate, jewels, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite another line&mdash;In a word, a thousand&rsquo;s offered&mdash;get the
      thing done, and we divide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown started. Two things occasioned this disturbance of
      constitutional self-possession; the first was the largeness of the
      consideration, and the second, an intimation that the business was in &ldquo;a
      new line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the parties, and what&rsquo;s the business?&rdquo; was the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the one I know nothing; of the other, particulars are contained in
      this sealed paper. The party who communicates with me, forbade it to be
      opened until the thing was put in train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how the devil,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown, &ldquo;can I enter on a business that I
      know nothing of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know generally,&rdquo; returned Mr. Sloman, &ldquo;what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a person in the way&mdash;he must be removed;&rdquo; said Mr. Sloman
      in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdered, of course,&rdquo; observed the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, Mr. Brown, I am quite surprised at the unprofessional
      nature of your remark. Do you see any thing particularly green about me,
      to lead you to suppose that I would make myself accessory before fact? I
      neither know the man, nor will know anything of the man; or what <i>is</i>
      to become of him, or what <i>will</i> become of him. I got this sealed
      note, and that there <i>flimsy</i> as retaining fee,&rdquo; and he held up a
      sealed packet, and a bank note for a hundred pounds, both of which Mr.
      Brown took and examined most attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sealed close enough,&rdquo; he said, laying down the paper on the table;
      &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s <i>genuine</i>,&rdquo; he added, after submitting the bank note to
      an investigation before the candle, to ascertain the authenticity of the
      water-mark. &ldquo;Is the five safe?&rdquo; he said, still playing with the hundred in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll freely deposit that hundred as security,&rdquo; returned Mr. Sloman, &ldquo;and
      now, in a word, is the thing in your line? Will you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; responded Mr. Brown, with a look of innocent surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Brown,&rdquo; returned Mr. Sloman, &ldquo;what the devil use in dodging with
      a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s dodging,&rdquo; replied the amiable host; &ldquo;pray may I read this
      paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, if you please, but tell me nothing of the contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a deep-un,&rdquo; Slowey and Mr. Brown again passed the bank note
      between the candle and his eye. &ldquo;Undeniable!&rdquo; he muttered, and next moment
      he retired to the corner of the apartment, at the special solicitation of
      Mr. Sloman; and then having broken the seal of the packet, Brown read the
      writing, while Sloman, in perfect ignorance of its import, drew the
      decanter closer, and as cocknies say, &ldquo;assisted&rdquo; himself liberally to the
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the worthy owner of the house had read the scroll, the effect upon
      him seemed astounding. His frame appeared convulsed, the lip whitened, and
      the hand that held the paper seemed scarcely able to retain it. He read it
      again and again, and then, crumpling it in his grasp, returned to the
      table, filled a glass of brandy, and drained it to the bottom; an example
      faithfully followed by his excellent friend, Mr. Sloman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. B., what say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This simply&mdash;the business shall be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the satisfaction of the parties concerned?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Sloman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; or you may keep the four hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to be disposed of, so that he shall give no farther trouble.
      Remember that, Mr. Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grave is the best security for that,&rdquo; returned the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop; don&rsquo;t tell me any particulars. Only let the thing come off
      like a business transaction,&mdash;you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly responded Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you undertake it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo;&mdash;and in that understanding pocket this retainer and Mr. Brown
      put the bank note into his breast-pocket. &ldquo;Come, as matters are arranged,
      let us have another bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&mdash;I must return to the person waiting your reply.&mdash;He
      will be impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the parties, Sloman?&mdash;honour bright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven! I know no more of them than you do; nor, stranger still, does
      the agent who proposed the affair to me. Best assured the thing is ably
      planned, and there are deep ones at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and I promise you that it shall be as ably executed,&rdquo; responded Mr.
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a gentleman of your experience,&rdquo; said Mr. Sloman, with a bow, &ldquo;it
      would be impertinent to offer advice. The fewer number of people employed
      in the job, (remember, I know nothing of it,) why the less chance there is
      of splitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brown assented by a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To an honest tradesman, like yourself, or a lawyer of character, like me,
      any thing to compromise us would be detrimental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A parting glass was drunk,&mdash;and the payment, its mode and certainty,
      all being carefully arranged, the excellent gentlemen separated with a
      warm shake of the hand, protestations of mutual esteem, and a God bless
      you! Mr. Sloman was emancipated by the churchyard door; the hunchback
      locked the grating; and Mr. Brown, having interdicted all visitors for the
      night, excepting the favoured few who had the private <i>entree</i> of his
      domicile, sate down &ldquo;alone in his glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The step of the hunchback was heard no more, as he had dived into the
      lower regions which he inhabited. Mr. Brown looked suspiciously about him
      for a moment, and satisfied that he was in perfect loneliness and
      security, he burst into a passionate soliloquy, and strange, the language
      it was uttered in was in Irish!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that he who waits for vengeance will not sooner or later find a
      time? Ha! the hour at last is come, when that heart, proud man, which I
      cannot reach myself, shall bleed profusely through another&rsquo;s. Let me look
      back. I remember well the moment when the jury returned my conviction, and
      the judge, to strike terror into others, sentenced me to eternal
      banishment, and ordered me to be transported from the dock. My prosecutor
      stood leaning against the bench, and returned my glance of impotent
      revenge, with one of supercilious disdain, as a lion would look upon a
      cur. Thirteen long years I dragged out in slavery&mdash;and such slavery,
      to one, who like me, had known the comforts which appertains to a
      gentleman&rsquo;s dwelling! I escaped&mdash;reached England&mdash;fortune has
      smiled upon me, and I am wealthy&mdash;no matter how the money came&mdash;and
      none suspect me&mdash;none know me as a returned transport save one, and
      with her the secret&rsquo;s safe. I never can be detected here for, fortunately
      for me, it was believed I failed in my escape, and was drowned attempting
      it. Has wealth engrossed my thoughts&mdash;has money made me happy? No,
      no,&mdash;vengeance, vengeance, haunt my very dreams! But it was not to be
      obtained&mdash;I dared not venture near the man I hate&mdash;the attempt
      would have been too perilous&mdash;I should be known, and if discovered,
      without the power of inflicting injury, I should be myself the victim, and
      my ruin would gratify the man I loath. Heavens! can it be true, and is the
      hour of vengeance come at last? It is! it is! Denis O&rsquo;Halloran, before a
      third night pass, the worm you despised and spurned in your hour of
      triumph, shall sting you to the soul! Now for the means. That Hebrew
      barterer in blood, who has changed his name and calls himself a Christian&mdash;he
      gave a necessary caution. I&rsquo;ll follow it&mdash;the fewer employed in such
      a deed the better. Ha, I have it! The body-snatchers&mdash;ay&mdash;they
      are the men. I can manage it through Frank.&mdash;He was one of them, but
      the labour was too severe for him. That devil-boy has in that puny
      frame-work, the ferocity of a tiger, and the cunning of a fiend; he loves
      mischief for itself, and doats upon a deed of blood. Yes,&mdash;the
      resurrectionists are the men; and they so readily manage to rid themselves
      of the carrion afterwards. There are three of them&mdash;surely enough&mdash;all
      young men, and two of them were pugilists. He is described as tall,
      active, and powerful, and his father&rsquo;s son will not be wanting in the hour
      of danger;&mdash;but what is one man to three?&mdash;Hark! the street-bell
      rings&mdash;I expect nobody to night!&mdash;Hush, here comes the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the hunchback entered, and announced that &ldquo;the gipsy&rsquo;&rsquo; was
      passing, and wished to speak to Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints and angels! the very person that I want! Show her up. Ay&mdash;we
      need a decoy&mdash;in every mischief, woman can be usefully employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The announced one entered Mr. Brown&rsquo;s great chamber, and addressed him
      with the familiarity of an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave town to-morrow,&rdquo; she began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the gipsy, sharply.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason you shall know presently. Mary,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;have you
      forgotten events that happened nineteen years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can they ever be forgotten, Hacket?&mdash;my own disgrace&mdash;my
      brother&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Mary, you have not the reason to recollect them that I have. You
      were never banished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not worse than banished?&rdquo; returned the gipsy. &ldquo;See what my life has
      been since I was disgraced and driven from my native land&mdash;with one
      passing gleam of happiness, a scene of guilt, and crime, and misery. Once
      my wandering career was stayed; I was loved, and raised from poverty; I
      was sheltered, protected, educated. My wayward destiny had found a home at
      last; and the evening of a troubled life promised to end in peace and
      quiet. Accident in a moment robbed me of him on whom my future fate
      depended&mdash;and I was again cast upon the world, when I had experienced
      enough of happiness only to estimate its loss more acutely. Have not
      misery and suffering been my companions since? I have felt the indignity
      of a gaol; I have been the inmate of a madhouse; I am now a half-crazed
      wanderer. Homeless and friendless I&rsquo;ll live; and when the spirit passes,
      no holy lip shall breathe a prayer for the soul&rsquo;s repose of a nameless
      outcast, who probably will perish on a dung-hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would you give for vengence on him whose fickle love caused you
      this misery and shame? Listen, Mary; before three suns go down in ocean,
      vengeance shall be ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? speak, Hacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Denis O&rsquo;Halloran shall be childless&mdash;through the son&rsquo;s heart I&rsquo;ll
      reach the father&rsquo;s.&mdash;Attend!&rdquo;&mdash;and Hacket rapidly detailed the
      outline of the foul conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With lips apart, and eyes fixed intensely on the narrator&rsquo;s countenance,
      Mary Halligan listened in silence. Suddenly the street-bell rang once
      more, and Haeket was called away, leaving the gipsy alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the son&rsquo;s to be slaughtered to break the father&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; she
      muttered,&mdash;&ldquo;and he thinks that I am savage as himself, and that I
      will aid him in his deed of blood. Alas! he little knows that woman&rsquo;s
      first love can never be obliterated. Five and twenty years have passed. I
      saw him recently; for the impulse was irresistible, and I crossed the sea
      to gratify the wish. Time had blanched his hair, the stoop of years had
      slightly bent his lofty carriage; and an empty sleeve told that he had
      been mutilated on the battle field. He passed me carelessly; but when I
      spoke, turned, as if the voice that fell upon his ear had been once
      familiar. He replied to me in kind accents, and gave me some silver as he
      walked away. Did I see him then as he was? Oh, no; I only saw the bold and
      handsome soldier, who, in the mountain glen, taught me first to love; and
      could I harm him because he trifled with a heart that never loved another;
      and, like an infant&rsquo;s toy, threw it from him when the newness of the gift
      was over? No; Denis O&rsquo;Hallo-ran, thy boy shall be preserved; or she whom
      you wooed, and won, and deserted, will perish in the effort. Ha! I hear
      the tiger&rsquo;s foot upon the stair; and now to deceive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that the scoundrel proposed, the gipsy warmly assented to&mdash;and I
      was placed under instant <i>espionage</i>. The thing of legs and arms,
      ycleped Frank, watched my outgoings from the hotel.&mdash;Hacket, through
      the hunchback&rsquo;s agency, settled with the resurrection men the price of my
      destruction&mdash;and all required, was a fitting opportunity to
      accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two modes presented themselves&mdash;secret murder or open violence. The
      first was infinitely preferable, had my habits been irregular, and that
      consequently I could have been seduced into some of the convenient
      slaughter-houses, with which the metropolis then abounded. Places there
      were enough; but the difficulty was, how should I be gotten there? Women
      were employed, but Isidora proved a counter-charm. Scented billets,
      couched in ardent language, reached me daily; but the assignations were
      disregarded. Could letters be credited upon ladies&rsquo; hearts, I had done
      prodigious execution but I acted like &ldquo;a man of snow,&rdquo; and out-josephed
      Joseph. To Mr. Hartley I even submitted these amatory effusions, and in
      his company I actually kept two or three appointments. It was observed,
      probably from some blinded window, that another person was in my company,
      and that no attempt could be made upon me with success; and like Hotspur&rsquo;s
      spirits &ldquo;none did come, though we did call for them.&rdquo; Unknown to each
      other, Hacket and I played a deep and desperate game, the stake was life,
      and&mdash;as the cards turned up&mdash;I won it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why that a regular Emeralder like me, whose native soil is known to be
      favourable to the growth of gallantry as it is unfriendly to that of
      reptiles, should play deal-adder to the call of beauty in the streets, the
      following chapter may possibly account for.

      hen I met Isidora in her mountain home, her graceful person, aided by
      manners particularly <i>naive</i> and gentle, had fascinated me, and
      taught me, for the first time, to feel the influence of love. Hers was the
      artless beauty that man never gazes on unmoved&mdash;the coldest heart
      would own its power&mdash;and mine at once admitted it. But when a closer
      intimacy banished the timidity which a secluded life and conventual
      education naturally produced&mdash;when she looked no longer on me as a
      stranger, expressed her opinions freely, and conversed without restraint&mdash;I
      found her gifted with intelligence beyond what so young a life could
      warrant, and a spirit, in ordinary events, mild, gentle, and endearing,
      but one, if necessity required, capable of that devoted fortitude, which
      so frequently, in pain and poverty, raises woman superior to misfortune,
      and distances immeasurably the boasted heroism of man. I was now, by the
      permission of Mr. Hartley, constantly in the presence of his daughter. At
      his table a cover was reserved for me, and I was an inmate of a
      neighbouring hotel. In the various places visited by strangers to the
      metropolis, I daily accompanied Isidora; for in concerns of deeper
      interest her father seemed entirely engaged. I sailed with her on the
      river&mdash;I rode with her in the parks. Is it then to be wondered at
      that boyish fancy ripened into a strong and endearing passion?&mdash;one
      that no secondary impression could afterwards efface, and which, like the
      star of hope, brightened the darkest hour of my career, and finally
      crowned success with that best benison of heaven&mdash;woman&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third evening after my unsuccessful attempt to effect a
      reconciliation with Mr. Clifford, we had strolled westward, and, returning
      through St. James&rsquo;s Park, sate down to rest upon a bench beside the
      Serpentine. In the story of my life it was a day never to be forgotten;
      for I had told Isidora what could not have been a secret, and, amid tears
      and blushes, she had owned that to her father she could give now-only a
      divided heart. He who has loved at twenty, and excited a kindred passion
      in the object of his regard, can only fancy what I felt. The world seemed
      strewn with roses&mdash;the sky without a cloud. Was not Isidora mine? and
      rich in woman&rsquo;s love, what else was to be wished for? Alas! how many
      trials were before me, ere that haven of happiness was won!
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned before, Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s business was so engrossing, that from
      breakfast time we rarely saw him until he returned late to dinner. The
      evening was closing, and the chimes of St. Martin&rsquo;s steeple warned us that
      we should resume our walk. The bench on which we had been sitting was
      directly in front of a clump of trees; and on moving a pace or two, we
      perceived, for the first time, that a tall and singular looking woman was
      standing immediately beside us, although until we had risen the shrubs
      effectually concealed her. Her figure and attitude were graceful, and the
      outline of the countenance fine&mdash;with a complexion so dark, and eyes
      so brilliant, that they at once betrayed a gipsy origin. She was past the
      middle age&mdash;but when a girl, she no doubt possessed the beauty for
      which that singular race are so remarkable. She regarded me with fixed
      attention; her eyes glancing slightly at my fair companion, and then
      settling upon mine with a stealthy expression of inquiry. We attempted to
      pass her, but she raised her arm, and signed that we should remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do ye want, good woman?&rdquo; I said, as I offered her some silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not money,&rdquo; was her reply, and she pushed back the hand I had extended.
      &ldquo;I would speak with you, and speak with you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me! You can have no business with a stranger&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With strangers I have none. With you I have important business,&rdquo; returned
      the gipsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unknown to you, my friend.&rdquo; She smiled incredulously, and then
      peering sharply at my face, she measured me with a glance from head to
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could not be mistaken&mdash;the air, the height, the figure&mdash;all,
      all, are similar. The same firm step and haughty carriage; ay, and the eye
      and lip too are his; the rest, the softer features of his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isidora, startled at the wild attitude and address of the wanderer, clung
      closely to my arm for protection. The gipsy noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, from me you have nothing to dread. I may not be able to serve you,
      and who would injure you? Give me your hand. Nay, fear not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have no faith in fortune-telling and I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That smile too is his father&rsquo;s. Come, lady, let me but look one moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pressed Isidora to comply with the gipsy&rsquo;s request; and, with a smile,
      she presented her hand to the fortune-teller. The latter scanned the lines
      attentively, and then whispered something in my companion&rsquo;s ear, but in a
      voice so low, that to me it was perfectly inaudible. Its effect upon
      Isidora was striking. In a moment a burning blush suffused her cheeks, and
      eyes, turned before upon the sybil in playful expectation, were instantly
      cast upon the ground. The wanderer smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take not what I have told you as any proof of
      skill; a boy who saw half what I did unperceived would readily have
      guessed that secret. One look more. Your love will end prosperously; but
      the time is hidden from me. Trials and disappointments interfere, but
      prudence and patience will overcome them. May you be happy! It would be,
      in sooth, a pity if sorrow should dim so sweet an eye, or cloud a brow so
      beautiful. And now, to see what fate designs for you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kindly tone of voice in which she conveyed her wishes for Isidora&rsquo;s
      happiness of course had its full influence on me, and I freely presented
      the hand she desired&mdash;but still a sceptic smile accompanied the
      offer, and showed that in palmistry I was an unbeliever. She affected not
      to notice it, but proceeded with her mystic examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, laughing, &ldquo;what has fortune in reserve for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much that I can see, and more that is wrapped in mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see present danger, followed by perilous adventure. The end, however,
      looks happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The danger,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;whence and from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The source I see; the time&rsquo;s uncertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! this is mere folly&mdash;some proof. Give me this, or I shall say
      your art is all speculation on the common results of life, and founded on
      chance of circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask, and I&rsquo;ll answer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was not aware you knew me. That knowledge is easily acquired. My
      profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else do you require from me?&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isidora had turned pale; for the readiness with which each question had
      been answered, seemed to infer that the gipsy really possessed the
      intelligence she boasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;one question more, and that if answered shall make me a
      true believer;&mdash;tell me my age!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;let me think a moment,&rdquo; she returned, and placing her open
      hand across her forehead, she seemed for a few moments to tax her memory,
      as if engaged in mental calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that was the year,&rdquo; she muttered; then, turning to me, she coolly
      answered, &ldquo;On Thursday next you will be twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused; and the surprise visible on my countenance announced to
      Isidora that the answer was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, one word before we part;&rdquo; and she laid her hand upon my shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;Hector
      O&rsquo;Halloran, beware! or your twentieth birthday will be as bloody as your
      first.&mdash;&mdash; Before we part, give me one promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I require you to meet me&mdash;when a writing with these marks
      attached to it, shall be placed within your hand&rdquo;&mdash;and she gave me a
      scroll&mdash;&ldquo;will you obey the order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered boldly in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well. Though my summons come in storm, and darkness, and at
      midnight, as you value life, obey it. Though beauty smiles, and music
      charms, leave all when that mystic signature is presented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isidora and I turned our eyes on the scroll. It contained only a couple of
      initials&mdash;but annexed was a singular hieroglyphic, representing a
      heart perforated with a dagger. I smiled at the device, while Isidora
      became deadly pale. The wanderer saw the colour leave her cheek; and with
      a gentleness of voice and manner intended to remove alarm, she thus
      addressed my fair companion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, fear nothing; all will yet be well,&mdash;and by courage and
      caution danger shall be arrested. Go, and God bless you! Remember what I
      have said and you have promised. You have deadly enemies; but, Hector
      O&rsquo;Halloran, you have one devoted friend. Ay, and humble as she is, trust
      to her; and if she do not save, she&rsquo;ll die in the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere the words were spoken, the gipsy had vanished behind the bushes,
      leaving Isidora and myself in marvellous astonishment at a scene equally
      unexpected and incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached home, Mr. Hartley was waiting for us; and after dinner,
      when <i>tête-à-tête</i>, I recounted our adventure in the Park. He
      listened attentively to the detail, and asked me many questions, to which,
      however, I could give no satisfactory replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at a loss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to fathom this singular affair. The woman
      could have no object in creating an unnecessary alarm, and yet her
      communication was so vague, that one cannot even guess what the danger is,
      or from what quarter it may be expected. Still her caution is not to be
      despised, and we must be upon our guard, until it pleases your swarthy
      friend to be more explicit than she has been. One course must be pursued.
      We must keep strangers at a distance, and look at all as enemies.&rdquo; He took
      the note I had received from Mr. Clifford on the evening after our
      interview, and read it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his signature indubitably,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;These well-remembered
      characters are not to be mistaken. Had he received you kindly&mdash;had he
      evinced the slightest symptom of abated displeasure when you addressed him&mdash;and
      did a hope remain that time could mitigate his callous feelings towards an
      erring child&mdash;I would, in that case, have suspected that in the monk
      you had that secret enemy of whom you have been warned to beware. But no&mdash;the
      Jesuit is secure; the dupe is all his own. He will be contented with
      rendering all future attempts to gain the old man&rsquo;s presence unavailing.
      That he can effect, and more would be unnecessary. To me, the occurrence
      is involved in mystery too deep to be even guessed at, and it seems one
      that time only can unravel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although to the amatory effusions which reached me by every post I was
      cold as St. Senanus, when he was so barbarously virtuous as to warn a
      single lady off his premises at midnight, still to woman&rsquo;s fascination I
      was not altogether insensible. By singular accident, I had encountered a
      girl of extraordinary beauty in my walks; and though her demeanour was
      modest and retiring, I still fancied that I did not pass her by unnoticed.
      She was apparently under eighteen; and to the sweetest face imaginable,
      united a faultless figure. Her mourning dress was simple and becoming; and
      her general appearance indicated an humble respectability. To have
      insinuated aught against the constancy of my passion for Isidora, should
      be, as Lord Ogleby says, &ldquo;by all the laws of love, death to the offender,&rdquo;
       but still, when we passed each other in the street, I found myself
      involuntarily look round. Once, I imagined that the pretty incognita
      directed a furtive glance at me; and then, blushing at detection, she bent
      her eyes upon the ground, and walked hastily on, as if prohibiting any
      attempt on my part to address her, had such been my intention. But by a
      strange accident, the introduction that propriety forbade, chance
      effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      My birth-day came. I thought upon the sybil&rsquo;s warning in the Park, and I
      confess that it was anything but an agreeable reminiscence. I was not
      afraid&mdash;for what had I to fear? It was &ldquo;an air-drawn dagger&rdquo; that
      impended; but still I was far from being quite at ease. The day was
      gloomy; a fog obscured the sun; the dull atmosphere would damp the
      lightest spirits; I felt its influence on mine; and when I reached St.
      Paul&rsquo;s, the gipsy&rsquo;s warning haunted my memory, and it seemed to announce
      emphatically a coming evil. Her words rang in my ear, and I thought I
      heard Her again repeat, &ldquo;Hector O&rsquo;Halloran, beware! or your twentieth
      birth-day will be as bloody as your first.&rdquo; I mused upon the prophecy&mdash;&ldquo;The
      ides of March were come.&rdquo; Well, the sybil said that courage and caution
      would overcome the threatening danger. Both should be exercised; and a few
      brief hours would fulfil or falsify the augury.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sombre thoughts were suddenly interrupted, for directly before me,
      and scarcely distant a dozen yards, I recognised the graceful figure of
      the fair incognita, whom fortune, good or evil, appeared determined to
      throw across my path continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should I address her as I passed? I wished to do so, but hesitated.
      Suddenly a man hurried rudely along, and pushing with violence against the
      pretty unknown, she staggered a few paces and would have fallen on the
      flagway, had I not sprang forward and caught her in my arms. The scoundrel
      who had done the mischief, dreading the consequences of his brutality,
      hastened away, and was speedily lost in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, a tavern was immediately at hand. I supported her in;
      obtained a private sitting-room, the assistance of the females of the
      house, and the incognita was speedily recovered. We were then left alone.
      I received her warmest acknowledgments for my kindness; and thus
      encouraged, I pressed my inquiries to learn who she was, and, with the
      timidity of a girl unaccustomed to hold converse with a stranger, by
      degrees I learned the fair one&rsquo;s history.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the orphan of a soldier. Her father, a lieutenant in the line, had
      fallen at the assault of Badajos; her mother, years before was dead; and
      her only living relation, an aged aunt, who, from infirmities, was unable
      to leave the house. They enjoyed a trifling independence&mdash;one that
      required careful management to render it sufficient to meet moderate
      wants, and maintain a respectable position in society. Hence she accounted
      for the necessity imposed upon one so young of appearing frequently in
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the simple story of a life, she threw a shadowing of romance that
      strongly interested me. In alluding to the narrowness of her means, my
      fair acquaintance mentioned circumstances which could not but engage my
      sympathy. Her aunt had fallen into the hands of a grinding solicitor, and
      been plundered accordingly; for how could an infirm old woman obtain
      redress, when opposed to a satellite of the law? Her father had demands
      upon the Government when he fell in his country&rsquo;s cause; but with no
      interest to support it, the claim was made and rejected. No wonder, then,
      that Irish chivalry at once prompted me to offer myself her champion, and
      I expressed a strong desire to visit her aged relative. With some
      hesitation, she acceded to the request, and named, for a reason I have
      forgotten, a late hour that evening for an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I asked what had excited this curiosity regarding the history of a
      stranger, and with what objects I sought a closer acquaintance with the
      incognita, I could not answer the question. To Isidora my allegiance
      remained unshaken; and yet some secret impulse urged me to cultivate an
      intimacy, which prudence should have interdicted, and every bond of love
      forbade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day appeared interminable. It wore away at last; and the hour drew
      nigh when I was to meet my young incognita. I told Isidora of my morning
      adventure; but I suppressed the fact, that an evening interview was to
      follow it. I feared that Mr. Hartley, from the habitual suspicion with
      which he scrutinized every transaction of life that bore a questionable
      feature, would not approve of my becoming patron to a girl so pretty and
      unprotected as the soldier&rsquo;s orphan, and therefore I kept that intention
      to myself. Some business called him out&mdash;my mistress complained of
      head-ache, and retired&mdash;the clock struck nine&mdash;I rang for my
      cloak and stick&mdash;for of late I never went abroad after dark without a
      stout shillelah&mdash;and, as I was leaving the room, Dominique placed a
      sealed paper in my hand, which he said had been just left with the porter
      by a person who disappeared the moment it was delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The billet was short; and the curious device attached to it, announced
      that it came from the gipsy. It ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me on the right-hand side of Blackfriars Bridge, leading from the
      City, precisely at midnight. The crisis is at hand! I wish to prepare you
      for it! Fail not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read the writing twice, and determined to arm myself well and obey the
      summons punctually. Mr. Hartley was from home. No doubt he would appear
      ere the hour of meeting arrived, and I waited his return for half an hour,
      but in vain. The evening wore heavily away&mdash;I thought of my
      appointment with the fair incognita&mdash;there would be time enough to
      keep it, and it would fill up an hour agreeably. I left the hotel, and
      walked briskly towards the place where the soldier&rsquo;s orphan told me she
      would be in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached the &ldquo;trysting place,&rdquo; and stopped before the entrance of a
      narrow lane, which the lofty houses on either side rendered still more
      gloomy. That mass of masonry, St. Paul&rsquo;s, flung its deep shadow over the
      space beneath it; and there I halted, looking towards the opening between
      the houses, from which I expected that my incognita would present herself.
      I was not kept long in waiting. A slight dark figure flitted past, and a
      soft voice asked, in well-remembered accents, &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; It was the
      soldier&rsquo;s daughter. She took my arm; and under her guidance, I entered the
      gloomy alley from which I had seen her issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must pause. &lsquo;Where was my foster brother? and how was that worthy
      personage employed? He, whose fortunes I have described as being so
      strangely united with mine&mdash;where was he now, when the crisis of my
      fate was coming? Stay, gentle reader. Leave me for a few minutes with the
      young lady&mdash;remember, the expedition was conducted on platonic
      principles&mdash;and let us inquire what befel Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole, and
      his excellent ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first week that Mark Antony and the rat-catcher favoured the
      modern Babylon with their company, no adventure of particular interest had
      fallen to the lot of either. As both these excellent personages enjoyed
      the perfect use of their limbs, their peregrinations were numerous, and
      every interesting object the metropolis contained, was visited from Tyburn
      to the Tower. In these agreeable excursions, as yet no opening to future
      fortune had been discovered. It is true, they had seen the world, and made
      sundry valuable acquaintances; and in return for <i>blue-ruin</i> and <i>heavy-wet</i>,
      received excellent advice, and also, a special invitation to attend the
      obsequies of a lamented gentlewoman, who had shuffled off this mortal coil
      in a back attic, two pair up, in Leg-lane. As this last token of respect
      to departed worth was to be strictly private and genteel, the sticks were
      taken from the visitors on the first landing-place as they arrived, and
      deposited in the ruins of a clock-case, by a man with a wooden leg, who
      attended funerals as chief mourner, and balls as master of ceremonies&mdash;and
      by this useful functionary Mark and his friend were ushered into the
      apartment, where all that was mortal of Mistress Ellinor Malone was lying
      in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company were already assembled, amounting to some thirty of both
      sexes, all friends and relations of the deceased, and natives of the
      Emerald Isle&mdash;and nothing could be more imposing than the general
      effect which the chamber of death presented. Mistress Malone was laid out
      upon a bench, with a frilled cap upon her head, and a plate of snuff upon
      her bosom. On one side, stood a three-legged table supporting an unequal
      number of lights; and on the other, there was a goodly supply of gin,
      porter, and tobacco. Around the room the company were seated, each
      gentleman supporting a lady on his knee; and, to judge from appearances, a
      more united company had never been collected in St. Giles&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being the latest arrivals from &ldquo;the ould country,&rdquo; the ratcatcher and his
      young friend obtained particular attention&mdash;and on being presented by
      the single-legged gentleman, they were received, in person, by the
      disconsolate survivor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Macgreal, ye&rsquo;r kindly welcome&mdash;and the same, to you, Mister
      O&rsquo;Toole&mdash;we&rsquo;ll brook ye&rsquo;r name, for it&rsquo;s a good one! I&rsquo;m in grate
      afliixskin, as you may parsave&mdash;but God&rsquo;s will be done;&rdquo; and Mr.
      Malone crossed himself. &ldquo;Patsey Doyle, fill the gintlemen a cropper ach&mdash;and
      put a drop in the bottom of a glass for myself, to drink to better
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glasses being duly filled and emptied, Mr. Malone feelingly continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, boys, af ye but knew my loss. There ye lie, Nelly! could as a crimpt
      cod; an when ye were sober&mdash;to be sure it was but seldom&mdash;the
      divil blister the better wife in St. Giles&rsquo;s&mdash;an that&rsquo;s a big word.
      Come, gintlemen, take a pinch out of respect for the dead&mdash;Lord rest
      her&mdash;amen!&mdash;and then draw a sate, an make yerselves agreeable.
      Patsey Doyle, there&rsquo;s a lemon-box in the corner&mdash;fix it, <i>avournene</i>,
      for the gintilmen&mdash;an now, Mistress Braddigen, may be yee&rsquo;d obleege
      us wid a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, an agreeable exception to professional melodists who never sing
      when people want them, immediately complied with the request of Mr.
      Malone; and having, as a necessary preliminary, removed all bronchial
      obstructions with a <i>johny</i> of &ldquo;cream of the valley,&rdquo; she executed
      with feeling and effect that beautiful ballad, intituled &ldquo;The night before
      Larry was stretched&rdquo;&mdash;and the well-merited plaudits of a delighted
      audience had just rewarded the exertions of the fair singer, when two
      fresh arrivals were added to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors were of the softer sex. One, was a stout gentlewoman of a
      certain age, whom he of the solitary leg announced as Mrs. Bunce&mdash;and
      the second, a very pretty young one, was also introduced as Mrs. Spicer.
      The fosterer and his friend, being the only gentlemen who could afford
      accommodation to the new comers, the master of ceremonies deposited the
      stout lady upon the knees of Shemus Kkua, while to Mark Antony, the honour
      &ldquo;of bearing the weight&rdquo; of Mrs. Spicer was entrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discernment evinced in the collection of the company would have been
      in itself a sufficient guarantee for its general respectability; and
      hence, the intercourse, on all sides, was easy and unreserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my sowl! a ginteeler party I hav&rsquo;nt been to these six months,&rdquo;
       observed Mrs. Spicer to the fosterer, after she had turned down a <i>flash
      of max</i> to &lsquo;a better acquaintance,&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and Malone&mdash;Lord
      comfort him in sorra!&mdash;shows the best of respect to his desaste lady.&mdash;I
      hope there won&rsquo;t be any ruction the night, and that the wake will go off
      agreeable. The Connaught stockin&rsquo;-man, who was bate at Phil Casey&rsquo;s ball a
      Friday night, died this evenin&rsquo; in Guy&rsquo;s Hospital. He left his death, they
      say, on Playbe Davis, for hitten him, wid the smoothin&rsquo;-iron, when down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was rather afeard, Sally, dear,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Bunce to Mrs. Spicer,
      &ldquo;that cross ould file, yer husband, wouldn&rsquo;t let ye out the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not a toe would I have got over the trashold ather,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Spicer, &ldquo;only something he heard druv him into the Minories, to ask after
      the carakter of a chap who came to lodge with us last Monday. By gogstay,
      if the ould ruffin comes home early, and finds me out&mdash;may be there
      won&rsquo;t be a purty <i>too-roo</i> kicked up? Well, the divil may care&mdash;as
      Punch said when he missed mass!&rdquo; Then, in a lower tone, she addressed
      herself to the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so gallows jealous,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that one hasn&rsquo;t the life of a
      dog. He, and his other wives&rdquo;&mdash;(for it would appear that in the
      connubial line Mr. Spicer had dealt largely)&mdash;&ldquo;were always murderin&rsquo; 
      one another&mdash;ay, and before the beak every week, and sometimes twice
      too. How, I have been married to him two months come Saturday, and sorra
      mark he could show agen me but one black eye&mdash;for I can bare a dale
      of provokashin&mdash;and that he brought upon himself too.&rdquo; She then
      continued to remark, that Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s temper was but indifferent, and
      when he had &ldquo;the cross glass in&rdquo; a saint wouldn&rsquo;t stand him. He had also
      &ldquo;a most aggravatin&rsquo; tongue,&rdquo;&mdash;and that evening, in alluding to a
      former acquaintanceship which had existed between herself and a drummer in
      the Guards, he used terms of so little delicacy, that a mutual interchange
      of compliments resulted&mdash;Mrs. Spicer, receiving the contents of a
      pewter pint, which token of connubial endearment was as promptly
      acknowledged with the boot-jack, by which it appeared an upper tooth had
      been effectually removed without the assistance of a dentist&mdash;a loss,
      on Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s part, ill to bear, as it was the only specimen of natural
      ivory he possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such light and pleasing conversation an hour passed unheeded&mdash;for
      minutes winged with pleasure fly unnoticed. Harmony prevailed; and, by a
      philosophic effort, Mr. Malone forgot his loss, and at the request of the
      company, and assisted by a violin accompaniment of the gentleman with the
      wooden-leg, he chaunted &ldquo;The Groves of Blarney.&rdquo; It is right to observe
      that, in the selection of the song, an affectionate deference to the taste
      of the deceased was observed, the said &ldquo;Groves&rdquo; being an especial
      favourite of his departed companion. If ever wake proved pleasant, Mrs.
      Malone&rsquo;s bade fair to be so. All were happy&mdash;Mrs. Bunee declared the
      ratcatcher an agreeable man&mdash;and the sooner that Mr. Spicer looked
      after his truant spouse the better&mdash;for, were the truth known, Mark
      Antony was making a wild inroad on a heart that hitherto, had not &ldquo;loved
      wisely, but too well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A change came o&rsquo;er the spirit of the&rdquo; night&mdash;the door unclosed&mdash;and
      a square-built man, with a grizzled head and most infelicitous aspect, was
      seen in the door-way, fixing a basilisk glance on &ldquo;that fair frail one&rdquo;
       who rested on the fosterer&rsquo;s knee. An interjectional remark from Mrs.
      Spicer left the identity of the personage indubitable&mdash;as she
      observed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ould divil, and no mistake&mdash;and maybe there
      won&rsquo;t be a reglar shindy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the gentleman paused in the doorway, he lost no time in opening the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ye&rsquo;r there, Sally Spicer!&rdquo; and the remainder of the sentence was
      couched in language which the Court Journal would pronounce irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where else should I be, ye ould, batter&rsquo;d-out apology for a
      Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out o&rsquo; that&mdash;tramp home&mdash;an may be ye wont catch it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can ye spare another tooth convaniently?&rdquo; responded his rebellious
      helpmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; for ye, Sal!&rdquo; returned the elderly gentleman, with a
      mysterious crook of the finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0014" id="linkimage-0014"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0221.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye may go to Bath,&rdquo; replied the fair one, &ldquo;and if that does&rsquo;nt agree with
      your constitution, why go to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she named a
      locality of much higher temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Sall, ye vont go, vont ye?&rdquo; and Mr. Spicer made an advance three
      steps nearer to the lemon box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the length of that nose of yours, and its the longest and ugliest in
      the room. If it would&rsquo;nt be an impertinent question, Mr. Spicer, what did
      ye do wid ye&rsquo;r other nine wives?&mdash;By gogstay&mdash;if all the
      neighbours say is true, Bluebeard was a gentleman to ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark was an unhappy one. A lady, whom Mr. Spicer in earlier life had
      honoured with his hand, had been found dead under suspicions
      circumstances, which rendered it a doubtful point to determine whether her
      sudden exit was attributable to gin or strangulation. In consequence, Mr.
      S. had to enter into a lengthened explanation at the Old Bailey; and
      &ldquo;having the luck of thousands,&rdquo; the jury gave him the benefit of a doubt,
      and finally left it upon gin. The allusion, therefore, touched rather a
      tender point, and hurried matters to a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spicer sprang forward, and seized his lady by the arm&mdash;and Mark
      Antony, retaining the other, put in a decided remonstrance. In Scott&rsquo;s
      parlance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Few were the words, and stern, and high,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      That mark&rsquo;d the foemen&rsquo;s jealous hate;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For question fierce, and proud reply,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Gave signal soon of dire debate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spicer, discommoding himself of his coat and neckcloth, made a
      sporting offer to fight for five pounds, which Mr. O&rsquo;Toole accepted, only
      making the consideration love, and not money&mdash;a proposition that was
      received with general applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all official accounts of modern battles, &ldquo;preliminary observations&rdquo; are
      prefixed. In early life, Mr. Spicer had been professional&mdash;but,
      obtaining what he considered a safer line of business, he abandoned the
      ring, to repose himself under the shade of his own laurels. Blinded by the
      green monster, he reckoned a little too much upon his former science,
      forgetting the odds that youth and superior size had placed against him.
      Both parties had their backers.&mdash;&ldquo;Now, old-un, mind your dodge!&rdquo;
       exclaimed the supporters of Mr. Spicer&mdash;while the admirers of Mark
      Antony, recommending the &ldquo;young-un to be awake,&rdquo; added, &ldquo;that the ould
      file was a deep dodger;&rdquo; and intimated that it would be advisable to &ldquo;look
      sharp to his left daddle, for that was his nasty one.&rdquo; One other appeal&mdash;and
      a last one, came from the corner; &ldquo;For the sake of Jasus, to keep the
      skrimmage as far from the corps as they could.&rdquo; The admonition was the cry
      of wisdom, and it was disregarded accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A briefer conflict never disappointed a sporting assembly. The artful
      dodge, on which Mr. Spicer depended, failed; and in trying his left, he
      received a <i>per contra</i> favour that brought the battle to a close. A
      flush hit sent him into the corner with astonishing velocity; and in his
      rapid transit, he took with him not only the master of the ceremonies, but
      also, the mortal remains of Mistress Malone, and the whole apparatus on
      which the defunct lady had been extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this appalling catastrophe, the outbreak of the chief mourner was
      responded to by &ldquo;the cry of women.&rdquo; The single-legged professor declared
      his ruin complete, that instrument from which he discoursed such excellent
      music being &ldquo;<i>in smithereens</i>,&rdquo; while it was exceedingly doubtful,
      whether that Mr. Spicer was not defunct as Mrs. Malone. When the first
      uproar had partially subsided, the corpse was lifted by the ladies&mdash;the
      polygamist raised by his friends and allies&mdash;and the fiddler allowed
      to regain his perpendicular as he best could&mdash;while the admirers of
      Mark Antony, after eulogizing his pluck, and paying a delicate compliment
      to his powers as &ldquo;a punisher,&rdquo; hinted that it would be prudent to
      withdraw, that it might be ascertained if Mr. Spicer had been gathered to
      his fathers, or whether he was only &ldquo;kilt, not killed and, finally, until
      the mortal remains of Mrs. Malone should be duly reported <i>in statu quo
      ante bellum</i>,&rdquo; which, being translated, means &ldquo;stretched genteelly as
      before the shindy had occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the ratcatcher the prudence of an immediate retreat was manifest; and
      while general attention was divided between &ldquo;the dying and the dead,&rdquo; the
      fosterer and his friend quietly levanted, leaving, what a few minutes
      before had been an harmonious assemblage, in most admired disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapidity with which Irish rows are commenced and concluded is
      proverbial. Under the directions of a sailor, the wreck was cleared; and
      Mr. Spicer, whose advent had brought on the battle and &ldquo;crossed the
      obsequies, and true-love&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; was declared to be still a living man;
      and being resuscitated by gin and neighbourly attention, he was once more
      committed to the care of his gentle helpmate. The dear departed one again
      received
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;The latest favour at the hands
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That, living, honoured her;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and the wake being restored to pristine solemnity, the afflicted husband
      resumed his seat, vented his sorrows in soft melody, and again gratified
      the company with a song. What were the after-proceedings at Mr. Malone&rsquo;s
      evening party we are not prepared to say; but no doubt some notice
      touching the wind-up of the symposium, might be discovered by the curious
      in the police chronicles of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon, the funeral of Mrs. Malone was correctly
      &ldquo;performed;&rdquo; and on the same evening on which I had made my <i>entree</i>
      on the world, that lamented gentlewoman bade it a last adieu. The mourners
      separated at the grave-yard, each to return to his respective vocations;
      and the captain and the fosterer retired to the Fox and Goose, to
      deliberate on affairs of paramount importance. The question was one of
      ways and means; and, as it would appear, the subject had not been
      considered until circumstances imperatively required that financial
      arrangements should be entered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; observed the ratcatcher. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re down to
      thirty shillings between us&mdash;and a week&rsquo;s rent due to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, before now,&rdquo; returned the fosterer, with a sigh, &ldquo;that
      something would have turned up&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid, copteeine, we settled
      in the wrong quarter of the town for any thing but love, drink, and
      fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks,&rdquo; said the ratcatcher, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m pretty nearly of the same opinion.
      Mark, jewel&mdash;what if we step over to the other side of the city&mdash;and
      may be we might hear of something that one could turn his hand to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late this evening,&rdquo; replied the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Mark&mdash;it&rsquo;s scarcely gone eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Shemus, the truth is, I have a bit of an engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, and what to do?&rdquo; inquired the ratcatcher, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;just as they sodded Mrs. Malone, a girl slipped
      this letter into my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, but an invitation to tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taa!&rdquo; ejaculated the captain, horror-struck. &ldquo;If ye take to taa-drinkin&rsquo;,

      Macknamara but these accursed taa-parties? May the devil smother the first
      inventer of the same!&mdash;And where are ye invited to?&rdquo; The fosterer,
      instead of answering the inquiry, presented the billet he had received in
      the grave-yard to the honest ratcatcher, who, with some difficulty having
      managed to decypher the writing, read the contents, which were as follow:&mdash;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not be mad enough to go,&rdquo; said the captain, as he returned Mrs.
      Spicer&rsquo;s flattering invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can I get over it?&rdquo; inquired the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now mark my words&mdash;for you&rsquo;re bent on it, I see,&rdquo; continued Shemus
      Rhua&mdash;&ldquo;your taa-drinkin&rsquo; will end in trouble. They say here, that
      Spicer&rsquo;s house is notorious for harbouring the most desperate characters
      in the Dials. If you&rsquo;re caught&mdash;no fair play like the wake&mdash;but
      you&rsquo;ll be set on by half a score, out and out, murdered, and no one to
      assist you. Mark, <i>astore</i>&mdash;stay where ye are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, like his greater namesake, Mark Antony, led by Dan Cupid, seemed
      determined to run blindly to destruction; and, disregarding the warnings
      of the ratcatcher, he resolved
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;To love again, and be again undone&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and accordingly departed for the domicile of Mr. Spicer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shemus Rhua, when left alone, ensconced himself in the casement described
      in the lady&rsquo;s letter, as &ldquo;the wee windy next the door,&rdquo; to take out-post
      duty for the evening, and secure the fosterer against surprise. Full of
      dark forebodings, he recalled to memory the divers misfortunes which had
      befallen his unlucky <i>protegee</i>, Dick Macnamara, and all were clearly
      attributable to his unfortunate predilection for drinking tea; and
      therefore, that Mark Antony&rsquo;s visit to Mrs. Spicer would prove disastrous,
      he fatally anticipated. Between every blast of the <i>dhudheeine</i>, he
      turned a suspicious eye to the corner of the street from which danger
      might have been expected, and proved himself thus invaluable as a videt,
      as he had been prudent as a counsellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s mansion was exactly in the state that the lady
      had described it&mdash;and, yielding to his push, the fosterer found
      himself in the presence of the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware that time was valuable, Mrs. Spicer, after mutual wishes of good
      health had been ratified by a glass of rum, proceeded at once to business.
      She hinted at the infelicity of her marriage&mdash;and expressed her
      determination to effect a divorce according to the forms of St. Giles, by
      which the tedious formalities of law are avoided, and no necessity exists
      for troubling the House of Peers. Of course, she must, as a prudent woman,
      provide herself with a future protector; and, in brief terms, she
      confessed the secret of her love, and tendered her hand and fortune to the
      safe custody of Mr. O&rsquo;Toole.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much soever the fosterer might have been flattered into a temporary
      flirtation by the declared preference of a pretty woman, still, true to
      the <i>cantatrice</i> and plighted faith, he declined the offer. But Mrs.
      Spicer was not easily to be refused; and considering that charms might do
      much, but money more, she added that inducement. Taking a key from her
      bosom, she proceeded to unlock a strong cupboard built into the Avail of
      the apartment, and, from external appearances, formed for a place of
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the place the ould fellow keeps his cash in&mdash;and
      may be ye&rsquo;ll be after askin&rsquo;, how I came by the key?&mdash;Feaks, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      tell ye.&mdash;You see, Spicer used to get mixed when any of the lodgers
      would stand the liker&mdash;and we had a cracksman over-head, and he was
      so smart a young man, and so obligin&rsquo;! Well, I picks the ould file&rsquo;s
      pocket, an&rsquo; he blind drunk; and, before he woke again, Sam Parkins had
      fitted this one to the lock. Poor Sam!&mdash;he was a spicy cove not like
      the dark sneaking body-snatcher that came after him.&lsquo;Gad, I&rsquo;m half afeerd
      to go up the stairs at night, for fear I would tumble over a stiff-un in a
      sack, as I did last Tuesday comm late from Con Halligin&rsquo;s house-warmin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
       As she spoke, she applied the key, while the fosterer was lost between
      feelings of astonishment and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! What are you doing?&rdquo; he exclaimed. But the deed was already done,
      and Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s treasury feloniously opened to inspection. From this
      depositary, his faithless spouse produced a small box; and on lifting the
      lid, the fosterer perceived that it contained a number of bank notes, with
      money in every variety of coinage, being the produce of that worthy
      gentleman&rsquo;s long and industrious life. The lady looked at her intended
      lover with a smile of triumph&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mark dear, I won&rsquo;t go to you empty-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose property is that?&rdquo; inquired the fosterer, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose but the ould screw&rsquo;s,&rdquo; returned the lady. &ldquo;Say but the word, and,
      Mark, every shilling shall be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! would you rob? and rob your husband too?&rdquo; ^
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and not leave the ould rogue a mag to bless himself upon,&rdquo; returned
      the unblushing offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant fosterer. &ldquo;By heaven! I should fear
      if I remained longer that the roof would fall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Mark darline&rdquo;&mdash;and Mrs. Spicer endeavoured to arrest the
      escape of her refractory admirer. &ldquo;Where will you get one that loves you
      so tenderly, and that will bring you such a lump of money into the bargain
      as myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is that money to be gotten?&rdquo; returned the fosterer, indignantly.
      &ldquo;By the worst robbery of all&mdash;the plunder of a husband by the woman
      who should stick to him to the death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, just and hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another minute!&rdquo; exclaimed Mark Antony. &ldquo;Every moment I remain here,
      I feel as if I were giving encouragement to a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been said, that &ldquo;hell has no fury like a woman spurned; and Airs.
      Spicer proved that truth. Her colour fled the glow of passion with which
      she had vainly urged the honest Irishman to share her ill-acquired wealth,
      changed to the ashy hue of hatred and, springing suddenly forward, she
      placed her back against the door to bar the fosterer&rsquo;s egress. He took her
      arm, and firmly but quieth, repeated his determination to leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;unless you take <i>me</i> with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, woman?&rdquo; returned the fosterer; &ldquo;and would you keep me here
      until your husband returned, and discovered jour villanous intentions
      against himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, a strong force from without dislodged the lady from the
      door, and the voice of the ratcatcher continued,&mdash;&ldquo;And, upon my soul!
      that may be done without much loss of time, as the honest man and a couple
      of d&mdash;&mdash;d ill-looking acquaintances, are coming round the
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s advent produced an instant and awful
      effect on the feelings and countenance of his amiable consort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Antony!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all ruined and undone. Off with ye at
      once!&rdquo; and she sprang forward to the window, and after a hurried glance
      down the street, added, in a voice of terror, &ldquo;Lost! lost!&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
      late&mdash;and there will be murder! Ha! I have it&mdash;quick, quick!&rdquo;
       and after locking Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s treasury, she rushed up stairs, followed by
      Mark Antony and his guardian genius, Shemus Rhua.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Spicer stopped before a door on the first landing-place of the upper
      story, and unlocking it, introduced her visitors into a dark apartment,
      filled with lumber and old furniture; and having cautioned them to be
      silent, as every movement could be heard in the next room, she hastily
      retired, with an assurance that she would deliver them from captivity so
      soon as she &ldquo;made the ould screw safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my conscience,&rdquo; whispered the ratcatcher, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in a nate
      situation, Mark <i>astore!</i> What did I tell ye ye&rsquo;r taa-drinkin&rsquo; would
      bring us to? Cromwell&rsquo;s curse on the importer of the same herb, say I&mdash;for
      luck nor grace niver attended them that took to it! Here we are, as snug
      as if we were in Newgate, and that&rsquo;s pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shemus,&rdquo; returned the captain&rsquo;s companion; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re come!&rdquo; as the
      steps and voices of several men were heard ascending the lower stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this brief colloquy, the ratcatcher and his <i>élève</i> had each
      applied an eye to a fissure in the wood-work; while, ensconced in
      darkness, they saw distinctly afterwards all that passed within. The room
      and its occupants are easily described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former was a comfortless attic, with a blinded window, a truckle bed,
      and a few mean articles of furniture. In one corner, there were mattocks
      and shovels, with other implements of unusual formation, used by gentlemen
      in the resurrection line; while in another, there appeared a choice
      collection of jemmies, skeleton keys, and every tool employed in burglary;
      all bespeaking that the tenant of the room was a person of general
      acquirements, and equally an adept, whether taken as a cracksman or a
      body-snatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the twain was most remarkable. The elder was, a stout,
      ill-visaged, swarthy Hebrew, with voluminous whiskers, and a most
      repulsive face; the other, that thing of legs and arms, whom we have
      already introduced as the confidant of Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How devilish dark!&rdquo; remarked the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better at times for business,&rdquo; returned a second voice. &ldquo;Stop&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      a tinder-box on the table;&rdquo; and the sparkle of flint on steel, was
      followed by the steadier glare proceeding from a lighted candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite apparent that the caution to remain silent from Mrs. Spicer
      was necessary; for through the chinks in the crazy wood-work of a door
      which divided the apartments, the slightest sound was heard distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re full late, and the sooner we are off the better,&rdquo; returned the
      first speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be time enough for some people, for all that. A man can&rsquo;t go
      without his tools, Master Frank; and just keep yourself quiet, and I&rsquo;ll be
      with you in a shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, Josh. All&rsquo;s ready; and fortune has done more for us than I
      could expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Jew to the hunchback, &ldquo;and how is the trick to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safely,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Julia Travers has got him to meet her. Lord,
      what a girl it is!&mdash;There&rsquo;s not a decoy in London to be compared to
      her. He believes her to be a soldier&rsquo;s orphan&mdash;and she played her
      game so deep, and dressed so well too&mdash;I would have passed her myself
      in the street, and never suspected she was anything but a regular
      respectable. Well, Jim and the smasher are waiting at the dark turn of the
      alley&mdash;we follow&mdash;and while the chap&rsquo;s attention is engaged in
      front, his back will be to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand ye; and this shall settle matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ruffian took from the implements of his villanous profession, a
      murderous weapon formed of whalebone and lead, and then producing a glass
      and bottle, the hunchback and he drank a glass to good-luck, extinguished
      the candle, and, locking the door of the apartment, descended the
      staircase, and closed the street door heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the fosterer and his friend could express their mutual
      astonishment, the key was turned in the door of the closet where they had
      lain <i>perdue</i>, and Mrs. Spicer presented herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for the sake of Heaven!&mdash;My husband has gone for a
      minute to the Fox!&mdash;Hurry&mdash;or we&rsquo;re ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took Mark Antony&rsquo;s hand&mdash;piloted him down stairs&mdash;the
      ratcatcher followed&mdash;and when both had gained the street, she shut
      the door suddenly, leaving her lover and his friend, as they say in
      Ireland, &ldquo;on the right side to run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rapidity with which Mrs. Spicer had effected their deliverance,
      enabled Mark Antony and his companion to reach the street so close upon
      the heels of the ruffians, that they saw them turn the corner. By a sort
      of mutual consent, they too took the same direction; and, keeping the
      scoundrels in sight, regulated their movements as they proceeded. As the
      clock struck ten, St. Paul&rsquo;s churchyard was at the same moment honoured
      with the presence of divers personages&mdash;to wit, myself and the <i>incognita</i>,
      the Jew and the hunchback&mdash;and, by a strange accident, the fosterer
      and Shemus Rhua. How singular&mdash;that my deliverance from certain death
      should have been effected through the agency of my foster brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      While the parties paused for a few moments in the church-yard, the brief
      remarks that passed indicated the feelings and business of the triads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How imprudent this meeting must appear, sir! and how unguarded in a
      female to venture out at this unseasonable hour!&rdquo; was whispered in the
      softest voice imaginable to some remark of mine, as I passed the arm of
      the <i>incognita</i> through mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, the thing is safe!&rdquo; said the hunchbacked villain, in an
      under-tone, to his confederate. &ldquo;See how blindly the poor flat runs into
      the snare, and follows the beck of the deepest dodger that ever betrayed a
      fool! Stick close; and mind your blow! Oh, that I had man&rsquo;s strength!&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      not in Britain one who loves a daring deed more dearly.&mdash;Would that
      the arm was equal to the heart!&mdash;How I shall delight to see that tall
      idiot, who would stare or smile at my deformity, grovelling on the earth,
      and wondering how he contrived to get his skull cracked, while he thought
      only of Julia&rsquo;s charms, and fancied himself in full security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can ye see them, captain?&rdquo; whispered the fosterer; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t distinctly,
      the night&rsquo;s so dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many a darker one I have watched the soldiers pass me on the heather,
      after I was an outlaw,&rdquo; replied the ratcatcher. &ldquo;I see a man and woman.
      See, they turn to the right, under yonder drowsy-looking lamp; and there&mdash;those
      other two&mdash;one the dark scoundrel we overheard, and the cursed
      cripple he was talkin&rsquo; to. What are we to do, Mark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to the villains like a brace of blood-hounds,&rdquo; replied the
      fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t half like it,&rdquo; said the ratcatcher; &ldquo;remember, Mark, how nearly I
      was being hanged about the tailor&rsquo;s wife. There&rsquo;s sure to be murder; and,
      holy Mary! all this comes out of taa-drinkin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through dark and intricate turnings, the soldier&rsquo;s daughter conducted me.
      I found the arm that was locked in mine tremble, and yet the night was far
      from cold. As we advanced, the lanes became darker and less frequented,
      and I could not avoid remarking, how dreary and deserted the immediate
      neighbourhood of my young friend&rsquo;s residence appeared to be. She replied&mdash;the
      tone of voice was agitated. Was she ill? I asked the question, and gently
      put my arm round her for support. Suddenly, some terrible emotion
      convulsed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she exclaimed: &ldquo;not for thousands will I do it!
      There&rsquo;s guilt enough upon my soul already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Julia,&rdquo; I said, not clearly hearing what she said; &ldquo;I must get you
      assistance. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another step,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Return&mdash;quick, quick&mdash;away,
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught my hand convulsively, turned her lips to my ear, whispered in a
      deep, low voice, &ldquo;Ten paces further, and <i>you are murdered!</i>&rdquo; and
      bounding from my side, vanished in the darkness, leaving me the most
      confounded gentleman that ever followed that will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp&mdash;a
      woman.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was pitch dark,
      and the locality as much unknown as if I had been dropped into Kamschatka.
      What the devil was I to do? I threw my cloak off, rolled it round my left
      arm, and firmly grasped my sapling; then, commending myself to the
      especial protection of St. Patrick, I endeavoured to retrace my steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I blundered on for half a minute, a low rascally whistle immediately in my
      rear assuring me that I was in vicarious society, from which the sooner I
      parted company the better. Moving a pace or two forward, my steps
      evidently attracted the attention of the scoundrels, for a low voice
      inquired, &ldquo;Is that you&mdash;Josh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never felt less inclination to be communicative, and silently continued
      my retreat. The suspicions of the cut-throats were confirmed. I heard a
      voice desire his comrade to &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; adding, with an oath, &ldquo;the bird&rsquo;s
      alarmed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was idle attempting to steal a march upon an enemy already on the
      alert; and a dreadful conviction shot across my mind, that escape from
      assassination was hopeless. To be coldly butchered in the dark&mdash;to be
      hurried from the stage of life at the very moment of my entrance on it&mdash;and
      in the spring of manhood to fill a bloody grave, with every thing
      prospectively before me which renders human existence desirable&mdash;the
      thought was horrible. These feelings were but momentary, and other ideas
      filled my mind. To resist to the uttermost&mdash;to display, even in
      death, a tiger-like ferocity&mdash;this changed the current of my
      thoughts, and a soul-sinking despondency gave place to the terrible
      calmness which desperate circumstances produce. I quickened my pace&mdash;my
      steps fell heavily on the pavement&mdash;the murderers increased their
      speed&mdash;and both parties rushed forward in the dark; I at random, and
      they in the full expectancy of attaining their object, and gaining the
      recompense which was to be contingent on my destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acquainted with the locality of the dark lanes in which I found myself
      unfortunately involved, the scoundrels closed upon me fast, and at last I
      was regularly brought to bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, villains!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s he&mdash;at him, Jim!&rdquo; was responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one thing the darkness favoured me. My sapling was unperceived; the
      ruffians closed fearlessly&mdash;and the first intimation that they had
      &ldquo;caught a tartar&rdquo; was by the bolder of the twain being sent to the ground
      with a crashing blow that shattered his jawbone, and rendered him <i>hors
      de combat</i>. His companion instantly fell back, and I was about to wheel
      round and continue my retreat, when a heavy blow from behind knocked off
      my hat, and a knife grazed my arm through the folds of the cloak that,
      fortunately for me, had formed its protection. Need I say that the fresh
      assailants were the bravo and hunchback? while, encouraged by their
      assistance, the scared ruffian resumed the offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015"> </a>

    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      My chances of escape appeared utterly hopeless. The ruffians, by dividing
      my attention on either side, had enabled the hunchback to creep in and
      grasp my legs within his long and bony arms. Happily the knife dropped
      from his hold in his first attempt to stab me, and the night was too dark
      to enable him to pick it up again. I strove to shake him off, but the
      wretch clung to me with that virulent tenacity with which a reptile coils
      itself around its victim. In the attempt to free myself from the cripple,
      I struck my foot against a stone, stumbled, and, before I could recover my
      footing, a blow brought me to the ground, the assassins sprang in, and my
      fate seemed sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That brief space of exquisite agony I shall never forget. Oh, God.&rsquo; how
      hard it is to die! and die, as I should, by felon hands, prostrate and
      powerless, murdered &ldquo;i&rsquo; the dark,&rdquo; without the satisfaction of even in an
      expiring effort &ldquo;stinging the wretch that stung me.&rdquo; That moment&rsquo;s misery
      was ended. Steps were heard. I hallooed &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice, and, saints and angels! an Irish one, replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback then hastily cried, &ldquo;Quick!&mdash;strike!&mdash;brain him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught the miscreant by the throat as the last word passed his lips&mdash;and
      next moment two figures flitted past my fading vision, as a blow fell upon
      my head, and laid me senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I awoke as from a dream. A man supported me; another put a cup
      of water to my lips; and a couple of crippled watchmen held their lanterns
      over us. I looked at my supporter; he was strange. My eye turned to his
      companion. In the dim light his features were not remembered&mdash;and yet
      the hand that held the water to my lips was my foster brother&rsquo;s. By
      degrees consciousness returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, the Lord only knows!&rdquo; responded the ratcatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not attacked&mdash;stabbed&mdash;knocked down? Who were the
      assailants? Where are they?&rdquo; I continued, as wandering recollections of
      the past flitted across my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra one of us knows who they were; but if you searched London through,
      you would&rsquo;nt pick out an uglier couple. One was a spider-built divil
      without a back, and the other a black-muzzled thief of a Jew, with
      whiskers you could hang your hat on. They&rsquo;re off&mdash;had luck pursue
      them!&mdash;and among these twists and turnings, ye might as well look for
      a rat in a rabbit warren, as ferret them out, the ruffins of the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose with slight assistance, but staggered like a drunken man, and,
      preceded by the watchmen to give us light, walked slowly on, leaning on
      the arms of my deliverers. We reached a public-house at no great distance;
      and having committed me to the care of the landlord and Shemus Rhua&mdash;guided
      by a Charlie, Mark Antony set out to find a surgeon, perfectly unconscious
      who the stranger was, whom timely assistance had so miraculously preserved
      from murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned; the discovery was made; and need I describe what a meeting
      between persons attached by the tie of fosterage, under such
      circumstances, would be? I heard the detail of my deliverance. The surgeon
      dressed my wounds, and pronounced them merely flesh ones; for the knife
      had only razed the skin, and, in the dark, the blow intended as a <i>coup
      de grace</i>, had missed the head, struck against the kerb-stone, and
      fallen on the shoulder lightly. That I had been marked out for deliberate
      assassination, the gipsy&rsquo;s warning, the adventure in Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s house,
      and the discovery of a clasp-knife and <i>jemmy</i> dropped on the field
      of battle, sufficiently established. We received those trophies from the
      venerable conservator of the city&rsquo;s peace, paid him a fitting remuneration
      for the services of his lantern, and parted nearly at the same spot from
      which a woman&rsquo;s wiles had so recently seduced me&mdash;to wit, St. Paul&rsquo;s;
      I to return to my own inn by a hackney coach, and the ratcatcher and my
      foster brother to repair to the place from whence they came, with an
      arrangement to meet next morning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That we would all our pilgrimage dilate,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whereof by parcels we had something heard,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But not intentively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove to Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s residence. He was at home; and as Dominique had
      signified that I was anxious to speak with him before he retired for the
      night, he was waiting my return in the drawing-room. I found him leaning
      against the mantel-piece, buried in deep thought. His back was turned from
      me; and as I unclosed the door softly, for a few moments he was
      unconscious of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might he be trusted yet?&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I think so&mdash;for
      he loves her. Would it not be premature?&rdquo; He raised his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Ha,
      Hector! returned! What means that patch across your forehead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An attempt,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;has been made upon my life, and failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Where&mdash;and by whom?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was I again in trouble. To recount the evening&rsquo;s &ldquo;moving accidents&rdquo;
       without a formal introduction of the soldier&rsquo;s daughter, would, as a
      narrative, prove lame and inconclusive, as to enact Hamlet with the
      omission of the Prince of Denmark. I doubted whether Mr. Hartley would
      approve of my advocating the young lady&rsquo;s claims upon the government; and,
      from his starched notions respecting female propriety, it was most
      probable he would consider a nocturnal interview not exactly a regular
      procedure. I commenced accordingly, &ldquo;in fear and terror,&rdquo; as the lawyers
      say; told a confused story of meeting a girl in a fog; blundered at
      bringing her into a tavern; and totally broke down when we met in St.
      Paul&rsquo;s churchyard, on our way to the domicile of her respectable relative.
      As we proceeded in the dark, no doubt I stammered more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Hector,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, &ldquo;out with the whole truth; I hate half
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On I went. With the acute auditor I had to deal with, it would be useless
      to attempt concealment; and he listened with deep interest, and, as I
      fancied, no trifling mixture of displeasure, until I brought my story to a
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a marvellous deliverance, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran&rdquo;&mdash;(He <i>mistered</i>
      me, and that looked squally)&mdash;&ldquo;and you seem a man born to be the dupe
      of villains, through the agency of that worst of curses, a vicious woman.
      One would have thought that your recent escape from spoliation and
      disgrace by that amiable coterie in Jermyn Street, would have made you
      rather cautious in forming acquaintanceships with strangers, and believing
      every fabricated tale you heard. I am a candid man, and pardon me, while I
      give you a proof of my sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I credit your tale, and totally disbelieve your motives. You could not be
      fool enough to remain for a second, in ignorance of the true character of
      this lady of the fog; for none but the profligate of her sex would accede
      to the request of a young gentleman of twenty-one, and, at first sight,
      grant him a nocturnal interview. This may seem impertinence in me, who,
      apparently, have no right or interest in inquiring into your love affairs&mdash;although
      I must confess, that in the selection of your female acquaintances you
      have not been particularly fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However imprudent, or, indeed, improbable my conduct may appear, I assure
      you, sir, upon the unblemished honour of a gentleman, that my motives were
      precisely what I described them,&rdquo; I replied, with a firmness of voice and
      manner, that at once guaranteed my truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley looked at me for a moment. He saw that his suspicions had hurt
      me; and, convinced of my sincerity, he held out his hand, which I
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector, I believe you, and acquit you of every thing but concealment. Did
      you know the deep interest I feel in all that concerns your character and
      future fortunes, you would forgive me in testing your motives and actions
      so rigidly as I do, and have done. No more of this at present. Where is
      that scrawl you received this evening from the woman whom you encountered
      with my daughter in the park? Your hand is feverish. Although you may not
      feel it at present, you could not have passed through the deadly struggle
      you have described uninjured. To bed, friend Hector; Dominique, a second
      time, shall look to your wounds, and I for once play gallant, and keep
      your appointment with the lady of the bridge. Hark! the clock chimes.
      Half-past eleven. The &lsquo;trysted hour&rsquo; is twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured Mr. Hartley that I neither required leechcraft nor repose, but
      was most willing he should bear me company. The negro was summoned; his
      master gave orders in a whisper; I filled a glass of wine and water; Mr.
      Hartley unlocked a mahogany case, presented me with a brace of beautiful
      pistols, and put another brace into his own pockets; told me they were
      loaded; and next moment the sable functionary appeared with a dark lantern
      in one hand, and a bludgeon in the other. All we required was the
      companionship of the ratcatcher and Mark Antony, to enable us to take,
      regularly to the road, and rob every coach within sound of Bow bell; at
      least, so said Mr. Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it possible, the night was darker than when I kept my assignation
      with the soldier&rsquo;s orphan. Three quarters chimed; and ere the hour of
      meeting struck, we were punctually at the place appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge was wrapped in fog; and the two or three lamps that still
      burned, flared such a dull and yellow light, as merely rendered &ldquo;darkness
      visible.&rdquo; The night was raw and chilly, and, save a few passing citizens,
      &ldquo;few and far between,&rdquo; the causeway of Blackfriars was deserted. It was an
      hour when none but the unfortunate are abroad; a night when only the
      houseless are encountered. All that was orderly were in-doors; and the
      elderly gentlemen, to whom watch and ward were entrusted, properly
      declined to exhibit a bad example of being found upon the streets, and
      ensconced themselves in comfortable corners of the night-houses most
      contiguous to their respective beats, leaving the dreary pavement to
      persons of indifferent reputation. No wonder, then, that we found
      ourselves in unmolested possession of the bridge. I took a position at
      that extremity which the gipsy&rsquo;s billet had pointed out; while Mr. Hartley
      and his attendant occupied the recess immediately opposite my post.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter chimed&mdash;another&mdash;and another. At last, dull as a
      muffled drum, one heavy stroke boomed from the clock-tower of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
      and announced the first hour of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, as he crossed the bridge, &ldquo;it is useless to
      remain longer here. Your prophetic friend for once has broken her
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis false!&rdquo; replied a voice within half-a-dozen paces&mdash;&ldquo;she is
      here!&rdquo; and a figure too much concealed for recognition flitted from the
      centre of the bridge, and boldly joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the scene must change; and once more we shall carry the indulgent
      reader into the close alley where Mr. Brown&rsquo;s domicile was situated, and,
      at half-past eleven, introduce him to old acquaintances&mdash;the worthy
      owner of the mansion, and Mr. Sloman, his respected friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated at the table, with all the appurtenances that rendered
      their former interview so pleasant; but the present mood of the worthy
      couple was very different from the former one. The countenances of both
      betrayed anxiety and impatience. To plot is one thing&mdash;to perpetrate
      another; and a deed of blood propounded and agreed to on their first
      meeting, was now in course of execution. No wonder that the scoundrels
      felt ill at ease; not that either felt the slightest compunction for
      hurrying a fellow-creature into eternity; the failure of the attempt was
      what they dreaded, with a fear, if the deed were done, that some
      circumstances should attend it which ultimately might compromise their
      safety. They drank, but the wine had no flavour; or if it had, it failed
      to call forth their approbation. They spoke but little; the sentences that
      passed were brief and in an under tone; and at the slightest noise without
      both started; each appearing impatient for intelligence, and yet half
      afraid to hear what the result had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil can delay them?&rdquo; observed Mr. Brown. &ldquo;The thing should
      have come off an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may have failed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sloman; &ldquo;or have done it, and been
      detected; or&mdash;but, thank God, I know nothing of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish! as much as I do,&rdquo; returned the owner of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say so, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; returned Mr. Sloman, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host directed a meaning look at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slowey, how soft you are! Well, don&rsquo;t fear; in England there&rsquo;s not a
      better hand at cracking a skull than Josh Levi; and at the knife&mdash;the
      creature&rsquo;s too weak for anything but light work&mdash;I&rsquo;ll back Frank for
      a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it, don&rsquo;t tell me particulars,&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer. &ldquo;I wish all
      was over; I safe in Mary Axe; and you with your four hundred snug in
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the cash right?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sloman deigned no reply; but, producing a leather case from his
      side-pocket, he reckoned over nine bank notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a nicer thing to look at, than a clean hundred-pound flimsey
      fresh from the Bank,&rdquo; observed Mr. Sloman, playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the street-bell rang, and a low and peculiar whistle followed the
      sound. Mr. Brown started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven! that&rsquo;s not Frank&rsquo;s signal,&rdquo; lie exclaimed. &ldquo;Something is
      wrong, or the hunchback would be the first to bring intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another, and a louder ring, told the impatience of the midnight visitor;
      and Mr. Brown descended to the lower story to ascertain who it was that at
      this late hour required admission. The answers from without satisfied him
      that the stranger might be let in. The chains rattled; the bolts were
      drawn; again the door was carefully secured; and Mr. Brown returned to his
      state apartment, accompanied by a very repulsive-looking gentleman,
      namely, the swarthy Israelite, who earlier in the evening had been
      reconnoitred by the captain and his companion while lying <i>perdu</i> in
      Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s lumber-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruffian&rsquo;s face was flushed, one eye was swollen and discoloured, the
      collar was torn from his coat, and blood-stains were visible on his hands
      and linen. His whole appearance was that of a man recently engaged in some
      sanguinary affray.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause ensued. Mr. Brown filled a glass of brandy, which the Jew drained
      to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Josh?&rdquo; said the host, in an under tone. &ldquo;Is the job done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mistake about it,&rdquo; returned the bravo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a tussle for it,&rdquo; remarked the host, as he threw a careless look
      over the outer man of the dew, which gave ample indication that the affair
      he had been recently employed in, to him had proved no sinecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, Mr. Brown, I have been in the general line of bisness
      these fifteen year; lifted three stiff&rsquo;uns of a night; been shot at
      half-a-dozen times; got lagged; escaped transportation; and gone through
      as much rough work as any man in the trade; and in the course of my
      practice, 1 never had a tougher trial than to-night. Another drop of the
      brandy, if ye please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is the thing right, Josh?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brown, who always came to
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe as a trivet! I&rsquo;ll tell you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;curse particulars!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sloman. &ldquo;You may mention
      the thing in confidence to Mr. Brown. I know nothing of what you are
      alluding to, remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, no matter, Slowey; Josh and I will talk it over presently. But
      where is Frank? No harm done him, I hope. I wouldn&rsquo;t lose that hunchback
      for a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not here?&rdquo; was the Jew&rsquo;s unsatisfactory reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here? No! We have expected him an hour ago,&rdquo; returned his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m blowed if I know any thing of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But out with it. Tell us how matters went,&rdquo; said Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in my presence,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sloman, springing from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re so devilish leary, you may go into that there closet,&rdquo;
       and he rose and opened a door, through which Mr. Sloman immediately
      retreated; &ldquo;and Slowey,&rdquo; continued Mr. Brown, in a lower voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
      find a slit in the door, and hear as much through it as will suit your
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that&rsquo;ere chap, he&rsquo;s so etarnal cautious,&rdquo; observed the Jew
      to Mr. Brown, when he returned. &ldquo;If men mean wots right&mdash;as they
      ought&mdash;why be afeard to talk on bisniss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; returned the host, as he applied his finger to his nose; &ldquo;and now
      about the job, old boy. Drink slow, Josh; a third glass will smother ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Israelite replaced the brandy he was about to bolt, and then continued
      his narration, which, though delivered in a low voice, was perfectly
      audible in Mr. Sloman&rsquo;s concealment&mdash;the fissure in the wood having
      been cunningly constructed for the purposes of professional espionage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ye see,&rdquo; said the bravo, commencing his murderous narration, &ldquo;Frank
      and I&mdash;and he&rsquo;s a handy little creature for a thing of legs and arms&mdash;were
      true to time at St. Paul&rsquo;s; and there we spied our man reg&rsquo;lar in tow with
      Julia. Away they goes together, and we follows close behind. When we comes
      to the place, the girl had mizzled, and Jim and &lsquo;the smasher&rsquo; gone too
      soon to work; and, my eyes&mdash;if they hadn&rsquo;t cotched it heavy! At him
      we goes from behind; Frank with his gully, and I with this here
      preserver;&rdquo; and the scoundrel exhibited the murderous implement he used.
      &ldquo;I niver, nowhere, saw a chap more wide awake. He fought like a good-un;
      and he was so knowin&rsquo;, that it was almost impossible to draw him. At last
      Bill and I divides his attention, while Frank gripped him round the legs.
      He stumbled, fell, and the game was up; for I fetched him a blow across
      the skull that would have shattered a horse&rsquo;s head, and left him dead upon
      the kerb-stones. Before I could strike again&mdash;for one likes to make
      things safe, ye know, Mr. Brown&mdash;two chaps jumps in as if they had
      riz out of the paving-stones. &lsquo;The smasher&rsquo; was grassed in a moment&mdash;and
      I knocked clean away. I nivir got sich a nasty one in my life! I was all
      astray after it&mdash;and I know nothing more whatsomever, only lights
      came up, and fresh ones joined the others. I sneaked off as well as I
      could, reeling like a drunken man, and leaving our customer dead as a
      mackarel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he&rsquo;s done for?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done for!&rdquo; and a second time the scoundrel produced his implement of
      murder. &ldquo;Is there a skull in England that would require a second blow of
      that small article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is safe enough, no doubt,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brown; &ldquo;but what can have
      happened to Frank? Hark&mdash;by Heaven! he&rsquo;s at the door!&mdash;All&rsquo;s
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The signal was a curious imitation of angry cats, accompanied by a low
      sound upon the house-bell. Mr. Brown at once hurried down, and gave
      admission to his hunchbacked favourite, who followed him to the
      upper-chamber, accompanied by the ruffian called &ldquo;the smasher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the joint inquiries of the Jew and Mr. Brown, the deformed one gave
      satisfactory replies. It appeared that in the act of falling, I had kicked
      the weak wretch from me with such violence as drove him across the narrow
      lane; and before he could gather himself up again, the fosterer and his
      friend achieved my rescue. Self-preservation was now the hunchback&rsquo;s care;
      and, crawling away unperceived in the confusion, he coiled himself in an
      obscure corner, from which, though concealed himself, all that passed
      subsequently was visible. Thence, he witnessed my recovery, and saw me,
      with slight assistance, leave the scene of the attempt upon my life. In
      several efforts to get off, the scoundrel had been nearly detected; and
      when he did succeed, he and his confederate were delayed by the removal of
      their disabled comrade; and hence, an hour elapsed before he could reach
      the dwelling of his worthy master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bill?&rdquo; was Mr. Brown&rsquo;s first inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stretched with a broken jawbone in the Fortune of War,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems the job was any thing but an easy one. But it&rsquo;s done&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s a satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been,&rdquo; returned the hunchback, &ldquo;if I had not dropped the
      gully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do ye mean?&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t he finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you are,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew broke in with a coarse contradiction, and swore lustily that I was
      regularly defunct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say,&rdquo; continued the being of legs and arms, &ldquo;that for a
      dead gentleman he spoke as plain as I do. He was a little groggy when he
      got up, but in a few minutes he walked away as steadily as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation! Speak low&mdash;but all is overheard&mdash;and the reward is
      lost, I fear,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; continued the hunchback, &ldquo;that my name is on the
      knife, and Bill has dropped his jemmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and the least clue will send the Bow-street villains after us
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t remain another moment,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sloman, hurrying from the
      closet, and catching up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, my dear friend; all may be yet put right. Frank, bring these
      gentlemen to the parlour. They will require a bit of bread and cheese
      after their exercise; and when I have spoken a few words to Mr. Sloman&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That an&rsquo;t my name!&rdquo; exclaimed the alarmed lawyer, as the scoundrels left
      the room. &ldquo;Damn it, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how can you be so stupid? I
      thought I was dealing with a safe man of business. What the devil do ye
      call men by their right names for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an oversight,&rdquo; returned the host. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind, Slovey&mdash;all&rsquo;s
      safe here&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll do the job better the next time we get an
      opportunity. Do we touch upon account to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a rap!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.. Sloman, peevishly; &ldquo;but won&rsquo;t you return the
      hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown answered only by a look, but that look was an expressive one. It
      said, or seemed to say, in the elegant parlance ol the present time,
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you may get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be off,&rdquo; observed the lawyer, seeing that all chance of
      restitution was hopeless, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like to be stared at by those
      body-snatchers in the parlour. The scoundrels never forget a man; and, as
      I attend the Old Bailey professionally, they might remember me on their
      trial, and call upon me to speak to character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, my dear friend, a minute where you are, and I&rsquo;ll do the business
      effectually. Do take a little brandy and water before you start. It&rsquo;s not
      to every body I give that Cognac,&rdquo; and the host left Mr. Sloman to refresh
      himself before he should set out upon his return homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback and his companions were seated at a table in the lower room,
      when Mr. Brown glided softly in. They had drunk freely, for the failure of
      the night seemed to have occasioned a general annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; said the larger of the Jews, &ldquo;I never, in the ring itself,
      received such punishment. And then the risk&mdash;and nothing for it. The
      attempt at murder is now a hanging matter. There&rsquo;s law for ye! Well, I
      suppose that chap Sloman will make us some amends, and come down handsome,
      as he should do, for our being regularly served out in trying to oblige
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never find grace or gratitude in a lawyer,&rdquo; returned the
      hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not stump up, why I say he has no conscience,&rdquo; observed the
      smasher, &ldquo;but here is Mister Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to have for this night&rsquo;s trouble?&rdquo; inquired the stouter Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sloman won&rsquo;t stand a rap, because the thing&rsquo;s a failure. I tried him
      hard; but he won&rsquo;t bleed, nor come down with a single flimsey; and yet I&rsquo;d
      give a hundred for what he has in the side-pocket of his coat; ay, and
      gain another by the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, would ye?&rdquo; inquired &ldquo;the smasher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and drop a pony over and above. Come here, Frank;&rdquo; and Mr. Brown
      retired with the hunchback, and left the ruffians to commune with
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed between the owner of the mansion and his favourite is wrapt in
      mystery. The former returned to the apartment overhead, &ldquo;to do the civil
      thing&rdquo; to Mr. Sloman; the latter, to arrange some pressing business with
      his confederates in the parlour. In ten minutes Frank announced that &ldquo;the
      gentlemen below&rdquo; were gone; and Mr. Sloman, having expressed his
      satisfaction at the intelligence, buttoned his coat closely over the
      side-pocket where his note-case was deposited, put on his wrap-rascal,
      wound a shawl around his throat to secure it against the night air, was
      conducted to the churchyard door by the host, and respectfully lighted out
      by the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No failure, I hope, next time, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; was the lawyer&rsquo;s valediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s all made safe already</i>. God bless you, Mr. Sloman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And these excellent gentlemen parted with a hearty &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; Frank
      closed the door, Mr. Brown returned to his great chamber, and Mr. Sloman
      hurried away in the direction of his own residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unbuilt piece of ground, not a hundred yards from the small cemetery we
      have described as the place on which Mr. Brown&rsquo;s house abutted, was early
      next morning the scene of public curiosity. There, a man had been
      discovered dead; his skull fractured by the blow of some blunt instrument,
      and his pockets rifled of every thing they had contained. Within an hour
      the body was duly recognised. The deceased was Mr. Sloman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were the murderers? Gentle, reader, I think you have a shrewd
      suspicion already. But &ldquo;time tells many secrets,&rdquo;&mdash;so says the Gaelic
      adage; and as none have doubted its accuracy, we&rsquo;ll wait for further
      information on the subject.

      ou are late, my friend,&rdquo; I said, as the gipsy stopped beside me and Mr.
      Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too late to warn you against the attempt, but in good time to
      apprise you of the extent of the danger you have eseaped, and implore you,
      as you value life, to profit by it,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are then aware that I have been assailed, and providentially
      rescued?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you witness the attempt upon my young friend&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Hartley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; had I been near enough, the attempt would never have been made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must have obtained a knowledge of it in a marvellously short
      time after the occurrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied the gipsy; &ldquo;and, as time is precious, I shall at once
      tell the means by which I gained that information. I had received an
      intimation that certain agents would be employed, and, anxious to learn
      the plans that would be adopted, I repaired to a place where I was well
      aware the ruffians could be met with. Earlier it would have been useless
      to have sought them&mdash;crime and darkness are companions&mdash;and the
      boldest ruffian of the party dared not venture from his skulking-place in
      the broad light of day. I went and found them, not preparing for their
      murderous essay, but foiled in the attempt, and venting, in impotent
      execrations, their rage at disappointment. From one maimed wretch I heard
      the particulars of their night adventure, after his companions, leaving
      him to my charge, had gone to report their failure to the scoundrels who
      had employed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after the danger&rsquo;s past, you come to congratulate my young friend on
      his deliverance! Methinks, it would have been doing better service to have
      apprised him of his peril, and not entrusted his escape from the
      murderer&rsquo;s knife to the accidental assistance rendered by some passing
      strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I not already cautioned him sufficiently?&rdquo; returned the gipsy. &ldquo;If he
      allowed himself to be made the dupe of an artful woman&mdash;one with the
      semblance of purity and innocence veiling a heart that from infancy has
      been familiarized with crime&mdash;and whose beauty seems to be given so
      lavishly, only to render her a greater curse to the community&mdash;was I
      to blame? All that a woman&rsquo;s art could do was done. Were he the offspring
      of first love, his safety eould not be dearer to a mother. Once more,
      Hector O&rsquo;Halloran, I come to warn you. Danger is averted, but not passed;
      and I repeat my former admonition: regard every stranger who approaches
      you as an enemy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, woman, with the knowledge you possess, why not end this state of
      insecurity? Tell us whence danger is to come&mdash;denounce his assassins&mdash;and
      the laws of England are quite sufficient to protect my young friend from
      those who seek his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save is one thing, to betray another; and I would preserve his life,
      if possible, without compromising that of one whom I know to be his
      deadliest enemy. But of one thing rest assured&mdash;should no other means
      succeed&mdash;the guilty shall be sacrificed and the innocent preserved.
      Farewell. Trust implicitly in me. Early to-morrow expect to hear from me;
      and stir not from home until my letter shall be delivered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away; we heard her steps receding in the darkness. Presently
      the sounds became fainter until they died away, and we returned to our own
      hotel, very little wiser than when we left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot even fancy who our foemen are,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, as he leaned
      thoughtfully against the mantel-pieee. &ldquo;At times a vague suspicion crosses
      my mind. That monk, and his associate, who have enthralled your
      grandfather, and estranged the dotard from the child who should have been
      the solace of his age, they look no doubt upon you as a dangerous rival.
      But were their fears greater, and did they wish, even by violence, to rid
      themselves of one who might mar their schemes, still the villany would
      require some time ere it could be sufficiently matured for execution. The
      secret motives which actuate that mysterious woman are also impenetrable,
      but her fidelity is beyond a doubt. Well, Hector, we must needs be ever on
      the alert until time developes more than we know at present. And now, to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We separated for the night; and never did the slumbers of a private
      gentleman prove less refreshing than mine. I dreamed eternally of every
      thing abominable. One time, the gipsy was sounding into my attentive ear
      her mystic warnings; the next, with smiles, sweet enough to bother any
      saint in the whole calendar, that demon-girl was beckoning me along dark
      and dreary passages,&mdash;and I mechanically following, although
      perfectly conscious that she lured me to the grave. No wonder that next
      morning I rose with an aching head; and then, for the first time,
      ascertained the extent of the injury I had sustained. It is true the hurts
      were superficial; but from the number of bruises my arms and back
      exhibited, many blows had fallen on both, although at the time they were
      unfelt by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was the last personage to present myself at the breakfast table. I found
      Isidora there, pale and agitated; for Mr. Hartley had just acquainted her
      with my narrow escape from assassination. To do him justice, he omitted
      every particular of my having undertaken to arrange Miss Julia Travers&rsquo; 
      claims upon the government; and, as &ldquo;good men blush at the record of a
      virtuous act,&rdquo; I was delighted to find that my beneficent intentions
      regarding the soldier&rsquo;s orphan were silently passed over. When I took her
      hand in mine, I felt it tremble; and, from the manner of both, had Mr.
      Hartley been ignorant of our attachment before, that morning&rsquo;s meeting
      would have betrayed the secret to one far less discerning than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      As breakfast ended, the postman&rsquo;s knock was heard; and presently Dominique
      presented several letters to Mr. Hartley and myself. His appeared to be
      full of interest, from the attention with which he perused their contents;
      and mine, to me, were equally important. One was from my father, and it
      apprised me that he expected to get me placed on the staff of one of his
      old friends, a general officer, commanding a brigade of the army now
      advancing towards the Pyrenees; and the other, a formal notification of my
      appointment, with an order for my departure forthwith for the Peninsula,
      by a sloop-of-war, which was to sail on the third day from Portsmouth for
      Passages, laden with money and military stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was reading my despatches, Mr. Hartley rose suddenly and left the
      room, to reply to one of his that required an immediate answer. More
      unwelcome intelligence never met the eye of a soldier of fortune, than the
      unexpected order to leave England now appeared to me. How differently the
      route for the Peninsula would have been regarded a fortnight since!
      Involuntarily I raised my eyes&mdash;and they encountered those of my
      gentle mistress. She had perceived that the letters I had just received
      contained news of no ordinary interest. I rose, and seated myself beside
      her, and gradually announced that the hour of parting was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not describe the scene that followed. Those who have loved as we
      did, can guess it well; and fancy what the &ldquo;cold in blood&rdquo; could never
      know nor feel. Isidora&rsquo;s hand was locked in mine; and my flushed cheeks,
      and her tearful eyes, told too well, how agonizing the first severance of
      love is. Suddenly the door opened&mdash;Mr. Hartley entered&mdash;he
      paused a moment in surprise; and, while she was covered with blushes, and
      I astonished beyond the power of free agency, he advanced and stood before
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soh!&mdash;what means this folly, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears flowed faster down his daughter&rsquo;s cheeks, while I,
      unconsciously, still held her hand in mine, and merely pointed to the
      letters that were lying on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley read them hastily, and, without evincing any mark of
      displeasure at the discovery he had made, he beckoned gently to his
      daughter, and next moment she was seated on her father&rsquo;s knee, her arms
      clasped fondly round his neck, and her head rested on his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isidora,&rdquo; he said, in that soft tone of voice with which he always
      addressed his favourite, &ldquo;I have been already prepared for this discovery;
      and had I been unfriendly to the growth of an attachment which I have
      witnessed with satisfaction, I would have discouraged the unrestricted
      intimacy which has existed between you and my young friend, and which in
      youth is ever too dangerous to be permitted. I think I have known the
      world too long, to have any doubt upon my mind respecting this gentleman&rsquo;s
      feelings towards you, my child; but, nevertheless, I will inquire of him
      whether I have correctly formed this opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My reply was a florid declaration of youthful passion, whose ardour
      elicited from my gentle mistress a look which told me that my love was
      faithfully reciprocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I believe you, Hector. Circumstances have hurried matters on more
      rapidly than I had expected. I have watched you suspiciously; for he who
      would trust his earthly treasure to the keeping of another, will be
      guarded ere he parts with it. I am satisfied that all which I value will
      be safe. Continue to deserve it; and when events, now in slow progress,
      shall have come round, and prudence justifies the step, this hand,
      Hector,&rdquo;&mdash;and he placed Isidora&rsquo;s in mine&mdash;&ldquo;the dearest gift a
      father can bestow, is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young love is eloquent, and I warmly expressed my gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour ago I considered that the time had not yet arrived, when you were
      entitled to demand my confidence,&rdquo; continued Mr. Hartley; &ldquo;I have now
      given you the strongest pledge of my personal regard; and you have a claim
      upon my unlimited confidence, which shall be freely admitted. We dine at
      six; and afterwards you shall know some particulars of the story of a man,
      whose very existence none, save yourself and this loved child, suspect.
      Little did you imagine that, in the stern monitor who blamed your follies,
      a kinsman was cautioning an unschooled novice against those seductions of
      vicious society which so often wreck the happiness of youth. None could
      have taught the lesson better than himself. He had erred and paid the
      penalty&mdash;and a life of peril, suffering, and disappointment, has
      scarcely redeemed the obloquy and disgrace which his earlier indiscretions
      had brought upon a name, which, but for his offendings, should have been
      second to none in Britain. Hector O&rsquo;Halloran, you stand in the presence of
      one, who, tempted, ruined, and rejected by all, became a castaway and an
      exile&mdash;I am Edward Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was I dreaming&mdash;or was it a reality, that the man who had exercised
      such mysterious influence over my thoughts and actions, was closely united
      to me by the bond of blood&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s brother&mdash;my grandsire&rsquo;s
      heir&mdash;but, dearer tie than all&mdash;the father of Isidora! My brain
      was in a whirl, when Dominique unclosed the door to announce that two
      persons were below, and anxious to see me. I informed my uncle&mdash;for
      that relationship with him I shall claim for the future&mdash;that the
      strangers were my deliverers; and in a few minutes after Isidora had
      retired, my foster-brother and the honest ratcatcher were formally
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Irish relationship that existed between me and Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole
      my uncle was already apprised, and he received the fosterer accordingly as
      if he had been an old acquaintance; but, touching the private history of
      Shemus Rhua, we were both as yet in blissful ignorance. All we knew was,
      that in the hour of danger, he had proved himself a jewel above price; but
      that he had arrayed himself in arms against the house of Hanover, eased
      Tim Maley of his purse, bled an old woman, or ferretted a rat, were
      interesting passages in the captain&rsquo;s life which we had yet to learn.
      Neither of my friends looked to the best advantage. The ratcatcher, in the
      <i>rookawn</i> of the preceding evening, had been favoured with a black
      eye&mdash;and the fosterer came out of action minus a skirt, with the
      addition of an awkward fracture in his unmentionables. Both had the
      appearance of gentlemen who had been recently in trouble, and from their &ldquo;<i>shuck</i>
      * look,&rdquo; had they presented themselves as bail, it is doubtful whether a
      fastidious justice of the peace would have accepted either, without
      instituting a slight inquiry into their &ldquo;whereabouts&rdquo; and general effects.
      I believe the meeting of last night was, on both sides, a fortunate
      occurrence. Never did man receive succour when he needed it more
      opportunely than I; while the fosterer and his friend had already
      experienced some difficulty in struggling against an exhausted treasury
      and wardrobe. A liberal present from Mr. Hartley (for that name must be
      for the present retained) placed the finances of the twain once more in a
      flourishing condition. I supplied the fosterer with an outfit for his
      outer man; the captain made a judicious selection from a fashionable
      emporium in the vicinity of Monmouth Street; and in a couple of hours, a
      happy change in both had been effected, and their persons were gay as
      their hearts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The morning wore away. No tidings from the gipsy had arrived; and Mr.
      Hartley and myself had just come to a conclusion that something had
      changed her intention of sending me a dispatch, and that it was
      unnecessary to wait longer at home in expectation of the promised billet.
      The fosterer and captain had returned from their morning&rsquo;s excursion; and
      Mr. Hartley, having heard their adventure at Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s on the preceding
      evening, was considering the best method in which that information could
      be employed to discover who might be the conspirators against my life. He
      was listening a second time to a narrative of their imprisonment in the
      lumber-room, where Mark Antony had ensconced himself to avoid the ire of
      an elderly gentleman, who, like Mr. Spicer, had &ldquo;not loved wisely, but too
      well,&rdquo; when the negro entered the drawing-room, and handed me a sealed
      letter, whose folding and address bore evident appearance of carelessness.
      I unclosed it hastily&mdash;the private mark annexed announcing that the
      gipsy was the writer. The contents were these:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well may it be said that the ways of Providence are inscrutable; for
      vengeance so sudden as to pass belief, has fallen on those who last night
      endeavoured to effect your destruction. Come to the Green Man
      immediately.&rsquo; There you will see those who employed, and those who
      undertook to murder you. Notice nothing which may occur; and appear to
      take no more interest in passing events, than any stranger in the room.
      Follow me when I leave the house, and let your friend accompany you. Fail
      not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall punctually attend the lady&rsquo;s invitation,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, as
      he perused the scroll for the second time, &ldquo;and we will also take that
      henchman of yours and his companion with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, these useful allies were dispatched, with proper directions
      to find the place appointed; and in half an hour, Mr. Hartley and I
      started in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at our destination, we found the street was crowded, and
      intense anxiety was visible in the countenances of a very numerous
      collection of idle people, to whom every act of atrocity gives interest.
      Indeed, it had been found necessary to close the tavern doors against all,
      excepting those who might professionally or profitably claim a right of
      entrance. The appearance of my uncle and myself, however, secured
      admission, and we were conducted into a spacious club-room, which had been
      selected wherein to hold the necessary inquest on a murdered man. A crown,
      judiciously applied, obtained convenient seats immediately beside the
      defunct lawyer and the persons suspected of his murder; and the fosterer
      and his companion had standing room assigned them, behind the chairs with
      which we had been graciously accommodated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That spacious room had witnessed many an hour of revelry. With the dance,
      the song, the laugh, and every outbreak of &ldquo;tipsy jollity,&rdquo; its walls for
      years had been familiarized. The present was a different scene. It was an
      inquisition for &ldquo;blood spilt&rdquo; by man; and the victim and his slaughterers
      were placed in the immediate presence of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deceased remained in the same state as when he had been discovered in
      the morning, and even the position in which the body had been found was
      scrupulously preserved. No doubt existed as to the cause of death, for the
      skull was extensively fractured, and <i>post mortem</i> appearances
      evinced that unnecessary violence had been employed; for any of
      half-a-dozen injuries inflicted on their victim by the murderers would
      have proved mortal. The features were painfully distorted; and the passing
      agonies of the departed man had been severe. Not an article of value was
      found upon the corpse; the pockets were turned out, and showed that
      robbery had succeeded murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the dead my eyes turned to the living. Five men were seated on a
      form, and behind each individual a man of peculiar appearance stood, whom
      Mr. Hartley told me in a whisper, belonged to a celebrated community long
      since extinct&mdash;Bow Street runners. On the persons who occupied the
      bench the gaze of all within the room was concentrated, and I examined
      them, from right to left, attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first was genteelly dressed, and his general appearance was superior
      to that of his companions. His exterior exhibited tokens of vulgar
      opulence; and watch, and brooch, and ring, all valuable, told that had he
      been criminal, the plea of poverty could not be used in extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him a man was seated, whose dress was shabby and general appearance
      disgusting. His head was swathed in a bloody handkerchief; and it was
      announced that, in a murderous affray on the preceding night, his jaw-bone
      had been severely fractured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third was a blackguard of ordinary stamp; but the fourth and fifth,
      Mark Antony and his companion at once recognised as old acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the hole in my coat!&rdquo; said the ratcatcher, in a whisper, &ldquo;I would
      swear to that dacent couple in a thousand. That <i>critch</i> * without
      any carcase, good nor bad, and the dark-muzzled scoundrel beside him&mdash;more
      betoken, I think it was himself, the murderin&rsquo; thief, that giv me the
      black eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglice&mdash;a hunchback.
</pre>
    <p>
      I looked at the scoundrels, with whose appearances the reader is already
      familiar. Gracious God! was I so nearly hurried from existence by the
      bludgeon of that truculent-looking Jew, or the knife of that contemptible
      hunchback? But my thoughts were speedily turned into another channel. The
      coroner took his place; the jury were empannelled; and the inquest
      formally commenced.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be unnecessary to trespass upon the reader&rsquo;s patience, and
      narrate in detail every particular attendant on a mercenary murder. The
      money intended to procure my death, by a singular accident, caused the
      assassination of the guilty wretch who had been the hired agent to effect
      it. In the remote place, and at the untimely hour when Sloman met a doom
      he merited too well, it was supposed that the foul deed would have been
      effected in full security. Guilt plots cunningly, but a higher influence
      mars the best-laid schemes. An outcast, without a roof to cover her, had
      crept for shelter into a dilapidated building, and, unseen and
      undiscovered, overheard the murderers arrange their plans. She saw them
      waylay the devoted wretch, knock him on the head, and afterwards, by the
      light of a dark-lantern, plunder the dead body. When they retired, she
      followed unperceived, and traced them into the dwelling of their employer.
      She acquainted the Bow Street myrmidons of the transaction; led them
      first, to the place where the murdered man was found, and afterwards, to
      the house where she knew the ruffians had been harboured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a singular fact, that the most cautious villains rarely escape
      surprise. The hunchback, excited by the adventures of that busy night, had
      drunk more deeply than was his custom. His weakly constitution soon owned
      the effect of liquor; and, in his confusion, he left the street-door open,
      although, in drunken wisdom, he fancied that he had effectually secured
      it. By that neglect, the officers obtained an easy entrance&mdash;and the
      murderers were seized &ldquo;red-handed,&rdquo; and in the very act of dividing the
      plunder of their late employer. The facts were already strong against the
      whole of the accused; but the hunchback&rsquo;s confession rendered the guilt of
      his confederates past a doubt. He became king&rsquo;s evidence; and the wounded
      bravo, whose fractured jaw had prevented him from sharing in the murder,
      corroborated the testimony of the thing of legs and arms. Mr. Brown, and
      &ldquo;the ruffians twain,&rdquo; whom he had employed to cause a vacancy in the
      twenty &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;th, by ridding the world of me, were fully
      committed&mdash;as I heard afterwards on the Peninsula, in course of law,
      were tried, found guilty, and suffered a felon death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watched the proceedings at the inquest, which occupied several hours,
      with an interest that can be readily imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the perpetration of a greater crime had thrown the attempt upon
      my life into the background, and steps were no longer required, either to
      secure my safety or bring to punishment those who had endangered it, still
      the cause of the assault upon me was so incomprehensible, that both my
      uncle and myself were anxious to trace the conspiracy to its source.
      Nothing during the inquiry transpired that in any way appeared to be
      connected with me; and, faithless to her promise, the gipsy had not
      attended. Although the room was crowded by a mob of the curious of either
      sex, had she been in the throng, from the singularity of her costume I
      should have easily recognised my mysterious acquaintance. The proceedings
      having ended, the jury were discharged, the prisoners removed, and the
      crowd dispersed rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Hector,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, &ldquo;the lady of the bridge, like others of
      her sex, is not always to be depended on. Where can that mysterious
      gentlewoman be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your elbow,&rdquo; responded a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started, and looked round. A woman, respectably attired, but whose
      features were partially hidden by a close bonnet that seemed formed to
      conceal the face, was standing immediately beside us. Could this be that
      wild wanderer who had accosted me in the park, and met me on the bridge
      when all but the outcasts of society were at home? I had no time left for
      closer examination&mdash;she tapped me gently on the shoulder&mdash;and,
      in a low voice, desiring me to follow, she mingled in the crowd. Mr.
      Hartley and I quietly obeyed the signal; while Mark Antony and the
      ratcatcher joined the rabble in the street, who were waiting to offer some
      unenviable tokens of the estimation in which Mr. Brown and his associates
      were holden, before they took a final departure for durance vile.
    </p>
    <p>
      We kept the gipsy well in sight, and observed her turning into another
      public-house at no great distance from the Green Man. We entered it, and
      were conducted by the barmaid to a back apartment, here we found the fair
      one seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter term is not used unadvisedly; for a finer woman, of a certain
      age, could not have been found in the metropolis. Nothing of her former
      wild and sybil-looking air remained&mdash;the eye had lost its keen and
      searching glance&mdash;the voice was softened&mdash;the very manner seemed
      altered with the dress; and when she laid aside her bonnet, Mr. Hartley
      and I freely admitted that the face disclosed to us had once been
      positively beautiful. When the door was shut, she turned her dark
      intelligent eyes on mine, and regarded me in silence for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;how striking is the likeness between the son and sire!
      and what painful recollections does that singular resemblance bring back!
      ay, though twenty long years of exile have passed away! But no more of
      this. Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, you see before you one who can hardly say whether
      she should love or hate the name. Time chills the deadliest enmities; and
      even jealousy and blighted hopes will own its soothing influence; and I,
      who should look upon you as an enemy, felt in your recent hour of trial
      all the agonizing uncertainty a mother only knows, when the child of her
      first affections is exposed to peril. With my early story, and wayward
      fate, it would be idle to detain you. None have passed through greater
      vicissitudes of fortune; none have sinned or suffered more than Mary
      Halligan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started. &ldquo;That name&rsquo;s familiar!&mdash;Were you the peasant girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through whose mistake Knockloftie, and all within its walls, were saved
      from violence and murder; I am that person. Ay, fallen, as I may now
      appear, I was innocent, admired, wooed, won, and deserted! Pshaw!&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      but a common tale in woman&rsquo;s history! No matter&mdash;&lsquo;tis past&mdash;it
      seems a dream; but, O God, it is a fearful one! I have not, however, come
      here to speak about myself. I come to tender my poor services to the child&mdash;for,
      from the bottom of the heart of her he wronged, the father is forgiven!
      Wild as my career has been, used as I have been to startling occurrences,
      still, the events of the last few days appear to me rather the coinage of
      a distempered brain than actual realities. Never did Heaven&rsquo;s anger fall
      so suddenly and severely on the guilty; and never was the innocent so
      miraculously preserved. Strange, that the same day on which a life
      commenced, should have been twice chosen to end it by secret violence!&mdash;and
      stranger yet, that the same hand, which in infancy designed to crush you
      in the cradle, in the very hour of manhood, but for Heaven&rsquo;s mercy, would
      have consigned you to a bloody grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the intended murderer?&rdquo; we both eagerly demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was one whose name is perfectly familiar to you. Did you ever hear the
      colonel speak of a person named Hacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred times. He was the villain that would have betrayed the old
      castle and its inmates to a band of murderers. They assailed it on the
      first anniversary of my birth-night, and were bloodily repulsed. I often
      have heard my father execrate that scoundrel&rsquo;s treachery. Another perished
      by his hand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! name him not. There were in the world two beings whom I regarded
      with divided love. One perished. Would that it had been by any other hand.
      I have forgotten&mdash;no, that were impossible&mdash;but I strive to
      banish from memory all that occurred upon that fatal night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Haeket was the person who devised and attempted my murder?&rdquo; I
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;another sought your life. He was but the agent of that person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom, then, was the wretch employed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I am utterly uninformed; and, strange as it may appear, Hacket
      was left in equal ignorance. If any knew the secret, it was the murdered
      man&mdash;and with him it rests. Have <i>you</i> no suspicions? Have you
      crossed the path of love, or barred the road to wealth? Are there any
      whose interests you have thwarted? Are you an object of hatred or of
      fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head; but Mr. Hartley replied to the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are, Alary&mdash;and more than one, the dearest objects of whose
      hearts this youth will one day overturn, as the child throws down the card
      edifice in a moment, which has cost him a world of pains to build.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look <i>there</i>, Hector O&rsquo;Halloran! <i>There</i> will your secret enemy
      be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, by heaven! You are on the sure track, my friend,&rdquo; returned my
      uncle. &ldquo;Where will deadlier feeling harbour than in the bosom of a monk,
      thwart but his ambition? or in that of a sordid scoundrel, who trembles
      for wealth acquired by knavery? Were you acquainted with recent
      occurrences in which our young friend has been connected, my life upon it,
      your conviction would be confirmed as to the quarter from which the danger
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I not worthy of that confidence?&rdquo; inquired the gipsy, in a tone
      that showed herself offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; returned Mr. Hartley. &ldquo;One day more, and I will give you
      ample proof of the dependence I place in your fidelity and discretion.
      That day I would devote to my young friend. It is the last he will pass in
      England for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is he then leaving England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ordered to the Peninsula, and sails on Thursday evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven send him better luck than his father! God knows whether you and I
      shall ever meet again!&rdquo; she said, addressing me. &ldquo;May the best fortunes of
      a soldier be yours! Farewell! I saw your first and your twentieth, and may
      your next be a happier anniversary than either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrung my hand. I left the room, but Mr. Hartley remained, and a
      quarter of an hour passed before he joined me in the street. We walked to
      the hotel, and there the fosterer and his companion were in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark, I am ordered off. What can I do for you before I leave England?&rdquo; I
      said, addressing the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Toole merely answered with a sigh &ldquo;hot as a furnace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I find you on my return? and how will you dispose of yourself
      in the mean time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dispose of myself?&rdquo; returned the fosterer, like an echo. &ldquo;Why, am I not
      also, ready for the Peninsula: Arrah! what would they say at Killucan, if
      you went to the wars, Master Hector, and I remained at home? <i>Mona-sin-dioul</i>,
      if I went back, the very dogs would not acknowledge me. But, love apart,
      where can I put in a happier twelvemonth? Have I not listened, till my
      heart beat again, to the old colonel&rsquo;s talking to the priest about the
      time when he stormed that village in the Low Countries where he lost his
      arm. Often have I fancied that I saw him bursting through the streets at
      the head of his noble grenadiers, scattering the French column like a
      flock of sheep, while the shout of &lsquo;Liberty&rsquo; was answered by a thundering
      &lsquo;<i>Faugh a ballagh!</i>&rsquo; It would be cruel, Hector, to leave me behind
      you&mdash;I will be no burden to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed a little packet in my hand; and turning to the window, the poor
      fosterer sentimentalized in secret, while I perused a letter he had
      received after we had separated at the inquest. With the course of Mark
      Antony&rsquo;s love adventures, that gentle affair with Miss Biddy O&rsquo;Dwyer
      excepted, I was altogether ignorant&mdash;and I felt interest in the
      fosterer&rsquo;s epistle. I read it accordingly; and, could woman rise in the
      estimation of one who loved as I did, that artless letter would have
      raised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have followed me to England. In that you have violated our agreement;
      but my heart offers a ready apology for the offence. I told you that
      twelve months must pass before we met again; and in that resolution I am
      confirmed. My brother has wildly ventured to the coast of Spain, on secret
      service connected with some of the guerilla chiefs in Arragon; and, in the
      mean time, I am resident in the family of the village clergyman. Mark, I
      am happy, because I am once more respectable. Let me remain until the year
      elapses under this good man&rsquo;s dwelling&mdash;and then that wanderer whom
      you protected in her hour of destitution, will prove to you that she has
      not forgotten her deliverer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, dear Mark, that when you rescued me from that villain
      Jew, you flung your purse into my lap, and pressed me to accept it? If
      that circumstance has eseaped your memory, it lives, and will ever live,
      in mine. Use prudently the small sum enclosed; and when another supply is
      needed, remember that the desolate female whom you generously saved from
      more than death, has now the means, and wish to prove her gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The epistle contained sincere expressions of affection, and was subscribed
      &ldquo;Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mark, what the deuce is all this about? and who is this lady, who
      forks out her fifty pounds, and subscribes herself &ldquo;most affectionately
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you again, Master Hector. But won&rsquo;t you let me go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, my dear Mark, I never intended that you should remain behind. Have
      we not been to each other as flint to steel from child-hood? Where should
      I now be but for your rescue? When boys, our joys and sorrows were the
      same; and now, as men, Mark, upwards or downwards, our fortunes shall run
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; said the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; inquired the ratcatcher, &ldquo;what the divil is to become of me?
      You can volunteer, Mark, but I am too old; and were I younger, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      much like to &lsquo;list; for I fancy that the guerilla line would be more in my
      way of business. But let us all go together. Blessings on that outspoken
      elderly gentleman they call Mr. Hartley! He&rsquo;s short in the grain as eat&rsquo;s
      hair, but the heart and purse are open. Here I am, new rigged from head to
      foot&mdash;ay, and rich as a Jew&mdash;bad luck to the whole community of
      them, root and branch!&rdquo; and the captain put his finger to the eye which
      had been damaged in the last night&rsquo;s contest. &ldquo;It was that long-whiskered
      ruffin that giv me this token of regard. Will, all&rsquo;s settled, and we go
      together, any how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been useless to offer any objection to the determination of
      the gallant captain; and, after a consultation with my unele, it was soon
      agreed that my fosterer should join one of the regiments of the brigade I
      was attached to, as a volunteer, and the ratcatcher enact <i>valet de
      chambre</i> during my absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time pressed. Mr. O&rsquo;Toole gratefully acknowledged, but returned the fifty
      pounds sent him by his mistress; swore fidelity and everlasting love anew;
      and by the munificence of Mr. Hartley, we all&mdash;to wit, the
      ratcatcher, the fosterer, and myself&mdash;were amply provided with that
      indispensable requisite for opening a campaign, properly designated &ldquo;the
      sinews of war.&rdquo; My future companions took their departure for the Seven
      Dials, to bid their loving countrymen, there dwelling, an affectionate
      farewell. An Irish parting is always accompanied by a heavy drink, as
      sorrow is proverbially dry. No doubt the symposium, like every other
      pleasant carouse, ended in a general engagement; for when the twain
      honoured me with a visit next morning, I remarked that the gallant captain
      had been accommodated with a second black eye, probably conferred upon him
      as a keepsake by one his agreeable companions.

      never sate out a more melancholy dinner than that with Mr. Hartley and
      his daughter on the last evening of my sojourn in the metropolis. Mine
      honoured uncle was gloomy and abstracted. Isidora looked the very image of
      despair; and I felt any thing but martial satisfaction at the immediate
      certainty of having an early opportunity afforded of &ldquo;fleshing my maiden
      sword.&rdquo; Like the courage of Bob Acres, my military ardour was hourly
      evaporating from my finger-ends. A month since, the prospect of being shot
      at was a matter of indifference; but in that brief space my feelings had
      undergone a marvellous change. From childhood, I had listened to my
      father&rsquo;s stories as he &ldquo;told how fields were won,&rdquo; and caught the
      enthusiasm of a man, every inch a soldier. But then I knew not what it was
      to love&mdash;I had not felt the witchery that attends a first attachment&mdash;the
      confession of mutual passion as yet had not fallen my ear, soft as angels&rsquo; 
      whispers to sleeping infancy. I had loved, and sued, and was accepted; and
      now this sweetest dream of life was to be broken; and from one dearer than
      all that earth contained, I was to be separated for a long period&mdash;perhaps
      for ever! I came rapidly to the conclusion, that glory was well enough in
      its way; but still it was an awkward business to have to seek it at the
      other side of the Pyrenees; and, had it pleased Heaven to bring about a
      general pacification, I think that 1 would have borne the disappointment
      like a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took no formal leave of my gentle mistress, for that unnecessary
      infliction of pain Mr. Hartley very properly inhibited. Our parting, as
      she left the drawing-room for the night, was probably warmer than was
      customary. She little imagined that I was to start at cock-crow for
      embarkation; and, in the expectation of meeting me at breakfast, she
      sought her apartment to court the soft influence of the drowsy god in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartley, as he addressed me, &ldquo;I regret that you are at
      this moment obliged to leave me; for something tells me that a crisis in
      our mutual fortunes is approaching. Were it any thing but the call of
      honour that takes you from England, I would at once ask you to forego it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear sir, never did a more unwelcome order come than that
      which Ï am about to obey! Could I but honourably decline it,&rdquo;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;that were impossible! Wellington has assumed the offensive,
      and every eye in Britain will watch the progress of his arms. A country&rsquo;s
      call is sacred, and it must be obeyed. God knows, in periling your safety,
      and exposing you to the common chances of war, I make a sacrifice that few
      could estimate. There is one tie that binds me alone to life; and, save
      for that alone, the sooner a spirit, soured by misfortunes, and wearied of
      a world it despises and detests, were freed from this &lsquo;mortal coil,&rsquo; the
      better. But were I in the grave, who would watch over the happiness of
      that being whom I idolize?&mdash;To one only would I entrust that holy
      charge. Need I name him?&mdash;Yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gratefully thanked my uncle for the~proof of confidence he had given,
      and he thus proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As my life and actions must appear to you involved in mystery and
      concealment, it will not surprise you much when I tell you, that for years
      I have been intimately informed of every occurrence that happened in your
      father&rsquo;s house. A stern necessity of secrecy obliged me to remain unknown
      and unsuspected. Had I been where I was supposed to be for twenty years&mdash;in
      the grave&mdash;I could not have been more removed from the knowledge of
      the world than I have been; and the reason I selected that wild and
      retired abode where you first found us, was to insure the incognito, which
      your interests and Isidora&rsquo;s demanded; for, strange as it may appear, from
      earliest infancy, you were destined for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really astonish me, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you hear my story that surprise will cease. With my past life none
      were even partially acquainted but a beloved child and faithful servant.
      You shall know more of that dark and painful history than they ever did;
      and when you have heard all that I have suffered and endured, then say
      whether, but for one endearing tie, a life, wretched and valueless as
      mine, would have been worth retaining for an hour. Fill, Hector&mdash;fill
      freely&mdash;many a day may pass before you and I shall meet again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed him. Rising from the table, he took a few turns across the
      apartment; it seemed an exertion to regain composure; it was successful.
      He resumed his seat, emptied his glass to the bottom, and thus commenced,
      what was to me a narrative of perilous adventure, but all-engrossing
      interest.
    </p>
    <h3>
      MY UNCLE&rsquo;S STORY
    </h3>
    <p>
      The career of vice is generally a simple history; a progressive advance
      from bad to worse, as the feelings deaden and the conscience, becomes
      seared and callous, by degrees. My earlier follies might have been easily
      arrested by parental intervention, but Mr. Clifford was reserved and
      proud; his displeasure was evinced by frigid mannerism, and his reproofs
      conveyed in the cold terms of general disapprobation. He never reasoned to
      the understanding&mdash;never appealed to the heart. I listened to him as
      I would to a lecture; and I came away without the slightest impression
      having been made upon an ardent disposition, which under better management
      might have been awakened and reclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ruin at last was consummated. I was discarded by my father; avoided by
      the good&mdash;deserted by the bad&mdash;and, finally, driven from the
      land, dishonoured and disgraced, where, by inheritance and birth, I should
      have held a proud position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months had passed since I had been alienated from an angry father. The
      means by which I had managed, for a time, to obtain the sums of money my
      extravagance demanded, had been overtaxed, and consequently, my resources
      were completely exhausted. The woman who lured me on to crime and ruin had
      heartlessly abandoned me, and those who had plundered me of hundreds
      refused me a shilling to buy bread! For a whole day I had not tasted food,
      and for two nights no roof had sheltered me&mdash;and without any definite
      object in my wanderings, I had turned my steps to the home from which I
      had been long since rejected. I was ashamed to let any who had known me in
      the palmy days of youth witness the degradation that crime had caused;
      and, after night-fall, avoiding the village, I stole unperceived through a
      broken paling, and, like a thief and not the heir, entered the grounds of
      Clifford Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Morley had been in boyhood my favourite companion. Although his
      birth was menial, I treated him, from regard, rather like an equal than an
      inferior. My purse was ever open to his wants; and my attachment gradually
      obtained for him the notice of my father. Step by step, he rose in Mr.
      Clifford&rsquo;s confidence, until he gained an influence over his easy master
      that none besides possessed. I fancied him a friend; and I had every
      reason to suppose him one, for his professions of regard were warm, and
      his assurances of gratitude unbounded. When the kindly relations between
      my parent and myself were first disturbed, I trusted to Morley&rsquo;s good
      offices to extenuate my offendings, and soften down the displeasure of an
      angry father. He promised to exert his influence to the uttermost. I
      believed him; followed his advice; and acted as he counselled. Alas! I
      little dreamed that Morley was all the while a deadly enemy, and that he
      was sapping to the foundation any slight remains of parental affection,
      and alienating the father from the child. Why should he thus play me
      false? and wherefore wear the mask of friendship, and hate me in his
      heart? Unconsciously, I had provoked his deadliest animosity by crossing
      his path in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morley was in heart a libertine; but he had sufficient cunning to conceal
      it from the world. A village beauty had been the object of his pursuit for
      months; and fascinated by her superior attractions, his secret attentions
      were incessant, and there was no reason to doubt but they would ultimately
      be rewarded by success. I returned, after a long absence, to the Hall. I
      heard of Mary Davis. A glowing description of her charms was given me. I
      saw her&mdash;report had only done common justice to her beauty&mdash;and
      I became her slave. My attentions flattered her pride&mdash;and the heir
      of Clifford Hall supplanted the son of a deceased menial. In a word, the
      weak girl eloped with me&mdash;deserted her peaceful home for a brief
      career of splendid profligacy; broke her poor mother&rsquo;s heart; drew down on
      me the lasting displeasure of my father; and rendered Morley my enemy for
      life. But of the consequence of my misconduct, 1 remained as yet in
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain his revenge, Morley worked secretly and steadily. Every act of
      imprudence was artfully communicated to my father; while the treacherous
      scoundrel led his confiding master to believe that he was kindly, but
      unsuccessfully, endeavouring to hide from him the criminal proceedings of
      his child. My slightest failings, blazoned by false colouring, appeared
      enormities. My letters in explanation were suppressed; the breach between
      us became wider every day; Morley&rsquo;s demoniac ingenuity at last was crowned
      with full success; I was discarded&mdash;looked upon as one dead&mdash;consigned
      to poverty and degradation&mdash;and became a beggar and an outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the villain&rsquo;s triumph, when, stealing through the shrubberies, I
      sought the well-remembered window of his apartment! Lights were burning,
      and there sat Morley. He had numerous papers and accounts before him;
      bank-notes and gold were spread over the table carelessly; and a bottle of
      wine was opened, from which, as I peeped in, he liberally helped himself.
      Heavens! how low had I fallen!&mdash;how abject did I feel myself! With
      me, indeed, the cup of misery was at the overflow. I dreaded to knock! I&mdash;the
      born-heir of all around, fearful to disturb the son of my father&rsquo;s menial!
      At last I mustered sufficient resolution to tap gently on the casement.
      The steward expected a different visitor. He seized his hat, hurried from
      the room, locked the door carefully, let himself out by a private
      entrance, of which he kept a key, and in another minute approached the
      evergreens to which I had retreated, and softly pronounced a woman&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morley!&rdquo; I timidly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;a man&rsquo;s voice!&mdash;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unfortunate&mdash;your old playfellow&mdash;he who once was your
      master&rsquo;s son!&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it possible! And have you <i>dared</i> to
      venture hither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once thought,&rdquo; I replied dejectedly, &ldquo;that none would question my right
      of entrance to this domain, which by birth and descent is, or should be,
      mine. I am indeed fallen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do ye want?&rdquo; he demanded, as I fancied, in a haughty tone. &ldquo;Why have
      you disturbed me at this unseasonable hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dire necessity obliged me to come here. I am perishing; food has not
      crossed my lips since yesterday. I am without a home,&mdash;the humblest
      shelter would be acceptable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot offer you one. Were it known that I spoke to you, or gave you
      the slightest assistance, your father would discharge me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his anger, then, so unmitigable?&rdquo; I asked in a desponding voice. &ldquo;It
      is beyond the power of being appeased. Advisedly, he would not breathe the
      same atmosphere that you did; and the most welcome tidings he could
      receive, would be those that assured him that you were no more return ed
      the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am starving!&mdash;pennyless! By Heaven, I will crawl into these
      evergreens, and die in sight of that mansion which once was destined to be
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morley started at the declaration. &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said he, with an appearance of
      more feeling than before; &ldquo;this is mere folly! Let me see&mdash;I dare not
      afford aught but temporary relief; and in doing so I risk the loss of Mr.
      Clifford&rsquo;s favour, were the thing discovered. Stay; I will bring you some
      refreshment, and see whether I cannot do something to save you from actual
      starvation afterwards he then returned to the house, and in a few minutes
      reappeared with the remnant of the supper he had eaten, and a portion of
      the wine I noticed on the table. I ate ravenously&mdash;drank to the
      bottom of the flask&mdash;and then listened to the false scoundrel as he
      thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a relation in London, who perhaps might enable you to leave the
      country for a season. It is possible that time might soften your father&rsquo;s
      animosity, were you removed beyond his notice; and the violence of his
      resentment might happily cool down. Here. It is a guinea, and some
      silver; &rsquo;twill carry you to London; and when you get to town, inquire at
      the Post Office, and you will find an anonymous letter to give you future
      directions how to act. To save myself from ruin, requires the greatest
      caution on my part. Push forward to the next village on the London road;
      and when you have reached the metropolis to-morrow, you will be fully
      instructed what to do. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, stay not another moment!&mdash;Steal
      secretly from the park, as you entered it; and all I can do for you shall
      be done.&rdquo; He hastily left me, as if in fear; I heard him bar the private
      entrance, and observed him close the shutters of his chamber, while I, in
      a state of humiliation bordering on insensibility, obeyed the order, and,
      like a felon, stole out of that domain where, two years previously, my
      will was absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept at a mean public-house; but what a luxury was a bed to me! and yet
      the lowliest servant on my father&rsquo;s establishment would have rejected what
      his fallen child gratefully received!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I put myself on the roof of a coach which in other days I had
      frequently driven. Neither guard nor coachman remembered me. Of course,
      the vulgar scoundrels had heard of my downfall. Well, they only imitated
      men of better birth! They forgot me when it was convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered London. It was the anniversary of a victory^ and I remembered it
      well. Two years before, by a singular coincidence, I had driven in with my
      own four-in-hand&mdash;and as the slang went then, it was &ldquo;the best
      appointed drag in England.&rdquo; Mary Davis was on the box. Ah, two years had
      made a difference! I was a pauper on a stagecoach&mdash;Mary Davis, a
      wanderer on the streets! A ice, with her, poor girl, commenced in luxury,
      but to both it brought what it generally does&mdash;ruin and disgrace!
    </p>
    <p>
      The paltry supply that Morley had given was half consumed by my journey;
      and I sought one of the humblest hostleries which London, in its infinity
      of accommodation, presents. The extent of my degradation had nearly
      stupified me; but next morning I went to the Postoffice to inquire for the
      promised communication, scarcely caring whether it arrived or not. The
      steward, however, had been punctual; and the expected letter was
      delivered. It was brief&mdash;written in a disguised hand&mdash;and merely
      desired me to call at some rascally place in one of the worst localities
      of the oldest portion of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded to find out the street, and with some difficulty succeeded.
      The person I inquired for was from home, but I was directed to a low
      public-house in the neighbourhood, and there I found him in company with
      several blackguard-looking personages. The room reeked with tobacco smoke;
      the table was splashed over with spilt liquors; the ceiling in many places
      had fallen in; and the contrivances to stop the broken casement, and
      exclude the air, were extraordinary. The man I sought took me to an inner
      closet, called for a stoup of gin, shut the door carefully, and then
      proceeded to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the gentleman Mr. M. has recommended to me?&rsquo;&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that unfortunate person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want to leave the country for a while? Well, there&rsquo;s no great
      difficulty in doing that, if a person was not very particular about the
      way he travelled. It&rsquo;s only getting lagged, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Lagged!</i> I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; replied my new acquaintance. &ldquo;Why I&rsquo;m certain I speak plain
      English. I mean, if you did not mind transportation, why you could travel
      at the king&rsquo;s expense. But I see you&rsquo;re raw. Well, I&rsquo;ll try how far I can
      oblige the gentleman who takes an interest about ye. Let me see&mdash;I
      have some appointments to keep which will detain me all morning; but meet
      me at eight this evening in the Borough,&rdquo; and on the back of an old tavern
      bill he scrawled, in villanous characters, the place and hour of meeting;
      told me to be punctual; drank the gin; desired me to pay for it; and
      conducting me to the door, left me to wear the wretched day through in any
      way I pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I might form any opinion from personal appearance, Morley&rsquo;s friend was
      every thing but respectable. &lsquo;Well, he was the fitter acquaintance for an
      outcast like me. I had none better left; and at the appointed time I
      crossed over London Bridge, to seek the place where the interview with the
      stranger was to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was found. I asked for Mr. Pilch, and was conducted into a
      private room. He was seated in the corner, with several companions round
      the table. They were gambling when I entered; but they put away the greasy
      cards, and then one by one dropped out, leaving Morley&rsquo;s friend and me
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have arranged this matter to your satisfaction,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      secured a comfortable passage for you to the States. The vessel will sail
      the beginning of next week, and you will have no time to lose in getting
      your outfit ready. I have been commissioned by a friend, who shall be
      nameless, but who you may possibly make a shrewd guess at, to give you
      what money you may require and, taking out a pocket-book, he handed me
      several bank notes. You will excuse the liberty I take, in hinting that
      this money is intended to cover the necessary expenses attendant on a long
      voyage, and not to be idly wasted; and therefore I recommend you to secure
      it well, and use it prudently. What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he perceived me
      about to put the notes into an outer pocket of my coat; &ldquo;do you carry
      money so loosely on your person?&mdash;in London too, where you cannot
      enter a tavern or cross a street without encountering a plunderer? Come,
      my young friend, take a lesson from an old and leary cove like me. Keep
      but one flimsey out for present purposes, and secure the rest, as I do, in
      the neckcloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand across the table and undid my handkerchief, folded the
      bank notes carefully within it, and then returned it to me. One five-pound
      note he desired me to put into my purse. My purse!&mdash;many a day had
      passed since I had needed such a conveniency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pocketed the money, and the stranger took his leave, appointing,
      however, another meeting at the same hour and place tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained after he was gone musing before the fire. I was astonished at
      Morley&rsquo;s unexpected generosity, and I secretly censured myself for having
      doubted the attachment of my old playfellow and friend. His bearing
      towards me on the night of my stolen visit to Clifford Hall was now
      perfectly accounted for. I thought it, at the moment, cold and heartless.
      I now perceived that it arose from a caution imposed by stern necessity;
      and the secrecy observed in the manner in which he had conveyed the
      liberal supply, now confirmed it. Even to the agent he employed I had been
      guilty of injustice. It is true, the man was neither prepossessing in
      appearance, nor polished in address; but the candid manner in which he
      exhorted me to be prudent, and the care with which he secured my money
      against accident, all proved a friendly interest in my welfare; and when I
      left the public-house, I admitted that I had slandered mankind, in
      imagining that pity for misfortune was banished from human hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I quitted the Coach and Horses, I remarked a man drawn up in a corner
      of the gateway, and standing in a position that intimated he wished to
      escape my notice. He wore a white hat, and, from rather a remarkable coat,
      I easily recognised him to be one of the men I had disturbed at play, when
      I entered the back room in search of Mr. Pilch. Well, he might have some
      private reasons for concealment; and it was no atfair in which I had any
      interest. I strolled onwards towards London Bridge, and happening to pass
      the shop of an out-litter, I stepped in to make some purchases for my
      voyage. The selection of different articles delayed me half an hour. Once
      I observed the man with the white hat pass the door; and again, I detected
      him peeping through the window. He was probably an idler; and I continued
      to purchase what I wanted in the shop. The articles were tied up; the
      account written and presented; I handed the shopman a five-pound note; he
      desired me to endorse it. I took the pen, and wrote a fictitious name, as
      I had determined to drop that on which I had brought so much obloquy and
      disgrace already. The man handed some change in silver, and I took up the
      parcel, and left the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had nearly reached the extremity of the bridge when I heard footsteps
      behind, and perceived several men running in the direction in which I was
      walking. They came up rapidly; and, in another minute, I was seized,
      pushed into a shop, and charged with felony. My identity was certain&mdash;the
      parcel confirmed it; and, to my horror, I heard the captors accuse me of
      passing a forged note. The charge astounded me; I could not speak, and my
      silence was mistaken for a tacit acknowledgment of guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned my eyes in mute despair at the men who surrounded me. By Heaven!
      one of them was the white-hatted stranger, who had been playing at cards
      with Mr. Pilch! It was providential, he could corroborate the statement I
      commenced. He had seen me&mdash;was a friend of Mr. Pilch&mdash;his
      evidence would be invaluable. I told the manner in which the money was
      obtained. My statement elicited a laugh of derision from the hearers. I
      appealed to the gentleman in the white hat, but the gentleman in the white
      hat disclaimed all knowledge of me, and goodnaturedly added, that he
      fancied he had seen me once before, at a fair he mentioned, in company
      with a party of the swell mob. My pockets were searched. Nothing to
      criminate me further was found. I casually looked round, and saw
      &ldquo;White-hat&rdquo; wink at-an officer, and point significantly to my
      handkerchief. It was instantly loosed and opened. My name was worked upon
      it in the dark hair of my faithless mistress; and five other notes were
      found; they were examined&mdash;and all of them pronounced forgeries!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute, I felt as if my heart had ceased its pulsations, but,
      gradually, I became conscious of the position in which I was placed. None
      could doubt my guilt. Could any deny that I was a felon? I, with forced
      notes concealed upon my person, of which I had uttered one already under a
      fictitious name. The observations of the crowd occasionally reached me.
      There was no difference of opinion as to my destiny&mdash;my career would
      close upon the scaffold!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh Heaven! if thoughtless youth could only fancy the agony of soul I felt,
      how many would be deterred from crime, and saved from ruin! To die!&mdash;to
      perish in the very opening of my manhood! And how die? Like a dog&mdash;stared
      at by a gaping crowd&mdash;pitied by some&mdash;laughed at by others&mdash;choked&mdash;hanged!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, by Heavens!&rdquo; I muttered to myself,&mdash;&ldquo;Never shall a Clifford,
      no matter how fallen, die such a felon-death! The grave is open for me;
      what matters it whether it hide me now, or in a brief space after? Come,
      man thyself, Edward Clifford, for a last effort&mdash;and die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remained but to convey me before a magistrate for committal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd retired; the officers took me away in custody. My passive
      conduct throughout, led them to set me down a heartless wretch, with whom
      hope was at an end; and mine seemed
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;The composure of settled despair,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      which enables the criminal to meet his doom in sullen apathy. How little
      they suspected the dark thoughts which then occupied my mind, or the
      deadly purpose which I meditated!
    </p>
    <p>
      An old watchman held my collar in his feeble grasp, and two or three
      others surrounded me. The mob kept generally in advance of us, to enable
      them to frequently indulge their curiosity with a view of the criminal.
      Before we had moved a dozen paces, I made a sudden spring, shook off the
      man who held me, overturned another in my rear, and started off, at
      headlong speed, to gain the bridge which was immediately contiguous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild outcry announced my escape; an instant pursuit succeeded. The mob
      were the only persons I had to fear; for the old men who watched the city
      then, wrapped in their great coats, and encumbered with poles and
      lanterns, were incapable of rapid movements. Several persons, however,
      kept me well in sight; they little knew that death, and not deliverance,
      was what I aimed at; and they raised a cry to warn the passengers who were
      approaching in the opposite direction. I saw several men draw themselves
      across the bridge to bar my farther progress. I stopped, leaped upon the
      balustrade&mdash;&ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; cried a dozen voices&mdash;they were the
      last words I heard&mdash;I muttered one brief adjuration to Heaven to
      pardon the act I was about to commit, closed my eyes, sprang from the
      battlement, and the waters closed over me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford paused. His usual stern composure was unequal to conquer the
      agitation which the terrible recollections of early imprudence had brought
      back. A short silence was unbroken, when suddenly the door unclosed, and
      the dark functionary presented himself, and handed me a letter of most
      unprepossessing appearance. He announced that the messenger would not
      leave without an answer&mdash;and ill-timed as the interruption was, my
      uncle signalled me to break the wafer. I obeyed, and communicated to him
      the contents of the following singular epistle:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>For Captain Hectur O&rsquo;Haleran, esquare, or Mister Hartlay, if he&rsquo;s out</i>.

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;i am sorray too inform ye we are in Trubbel and at Present undir the
      Skrew in the Watehouse they call Watlin Street, and all Contrarey to sense
      and Justis. We went into a dacint-lookin&rsquo; house, with a Woman without a
      head for the sign of it, and cald for half a pint, and sat down fair and
      asey at the fire, when in coms three Blakgards. Immadately they begins to
      rig us. &lsquo;Morra, Pat,&rsquo; says one of them. &lsquo;Devil a worse guess ye iver med,

      &lsquo;What the blazes have ye to say to my mother?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;What a hole you
      could make in a saucepan of patatays the night she was married!&rsquo; says he;
      and then he goes on aggravatin&rsquo; us, and abusin&rsquo; the old country, swarin&rsquo; 
      Saint Patrick wasn&rsquo;t a reglar saint at all, and not fit to powder Saint
      Gorge&rsquo;s wig, af he wore one. &lsquo;Oh! by the groves of Blarney,&rsquo; says Mr.
      O&rsquo;Toole, &lsquo;the divil wouldn&rsquo;t stand this i&rsquo; so he offs wid the coat, and
      offered to box the biggest of the lot for thirty shilhns. &ldquo;Well, they

      iver it was my luck to meet with! he made nothin&rsquo; of the chap&mdash;a
      couple of rounds settled his hash, and he gives in. &ldquo;Well, what does they
      do? insted of comin&rsquo; down with the battel money, they charges us on the
      watch, and we were bunddled off here, as if we were a pair of Pickpockets.
      We sends off to the Dials to say we were in trubbel, and before half an
      hour, there was the full of the street of dacent acquaintances. Some
      wanted to give bail, others offered to pull down the watchouse; and an
      honest man, whose father came from Ballyhawnis, went off to knock up the
      Priest, and get him to write us a Carakter. The divil a one of the
      bailsmen the constable would touch with the tongs; and so here we remain,
      snug and warm in the Black hole, unless your honir will bee plased to get
      us off.

      &ldquo;Perhaps the better course to be pursued would be to leave them where they

      The landlord of the hotel was summoned, and requested to effect the

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> cannot describe
      the sensations I felt, momentary as they were, while descending from the
      balustrade of London Bridge; but from the instant I struck the surface of
      the water, all recollection ceases. A considerable time elapsed before
      consciousness returned, and when it did, I found myself in the cabin of a
      Welsh coasting vessel, with a woman, her husband, and their son, (the
      owners and crew of the little schooner,) chafing my limbs, and using every
      simple means of resuscitation which their scanty resources could supply.
      Nothing could exceed the pleasure these true Samaritans evinced, when they
      perceived that their efforts had proved successful. They had no suspicion
      that he, the object of their care, had been hounded like a felon to do the
      desperate deed he had attempted; but, from the occasional remarks I
      overheard, they set me down as some desponding wretch, who, from very
      weariness of living, had rashly ventured on that fearful remedy, hateful
      alike to God and man&mdash;self-murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When perfectly restored, they made a bed for me before the fire,
      administered some spirits with caution, left me to my repose, and I sank
      into a profound sleep, which continued until morning. When I awoke. I
      found that my kind preservers, overnight, had dried my wet clothes; my
      breakfast was already prepared&mdash;and when I had eaten it, at my
      request they rowed me ashore in their small skiff, and landed me at Tower
      Stairs, with three shillings in my pocket, and not a friend upon the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered a low tavern&mdash;a house of call for seamen&mdash;and seated
      myself in the most obscure corner of the dark and smoky tap-room. Several
      men were round the lire with pipes, and pewter measures, and to the latter
      they frequently applied; while others were sleeping on the benches, like
      men after a debauch. They were evidently sailors, but they had not the
      free and honest look and bearing which generally distinguishes that
      careless and warm-hearted class of men. Their dark and weather-beaten
      faces were those of men habitually drunken, and indicated service in
      tropic climes&mdash;while, from their air and manner, you would pronounce
      them, at first sight, to be lawless men&mdash;bold and reckless ruffians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Bob, wasn&rsquo;t that job last night upon the bridge a funny one?&rdquo; said
      a swarthy fellow to an equally ill-looking companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter removed his pipe, knocked the ashes out upon the table,
      replenished it from a seal-skin pouch with fresh tobacco, and then
      leisurely replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, Jim; I have tipped them leg-bail in my time, but the chap last
      night gave them, wliat I calls, river security and he laughed hoarsely at
      his own wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed the first speaker, &ldquo;I likes a plucky cove; he wouldn&rsquo;t
      let them have the satisfaction of hanging him; and that jump in the dark
      robbed them as planted him, of blood-money&mdash;ay, and sarved them
      right, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend on it, Bob, he was a green&rsquo;un. No doubt a first offence;
      otherwise he would have taken chance of flaws and failures at the Old
      Bailey; for it was only scragging after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they found the body yet, I wonder? I&rsquo;d like to know whether it was
      any of our pals, Jim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure to float the ninth day&mdash;he won&rsquo;t lie longer at the bottom.
      They won&rsquo;t go to the trouble of draggin&rsquo; for him, will they, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll drag to little purpose,&rdquo; I muttered from the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellows turned round and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is there about that dead-un&rsquo;s carcass that a creeper should not
      grip it? Let me see&mdash;how was the tide?&mdash;it was Jack water at the
      time. I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar he&rsquo;s not lower down than Lime-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager twice the sum he&rsquo;s not half so far,&rdquo; I answered, with
      desperate composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do ye say he is?&rdquo; asked the fellow, with a stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&mdash;in this room!&mdash;seated on this chair!&mdash;and talking
      to you at this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, &ldquo;if that ain&rsquo;t a rum confession. I never
      knew in my born days, a man that passed forged flimsies split upon himself
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would I, had I done so&mdash;I am innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both ruffians laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said the same thing myself once,&rdquo; said the darker fellow of the twain,
      &ldquo;and I could not out of twelve men, good and true, get a single soul to
      believe the story.&rdquo;

      A couple of the sleepers wakened up. One of them stretched himself,
      yawned, and inquired, like a person still half asleep, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that
      gammon about innocence, forged notes, and blood-money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why, Captain, this here cove is the chap who jumped off the bridge; and as
      he&rsquo;s innocent, I suppose he&rsquo;ll go quietly to them he bolted from last
      night, and get hanged to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool he,&rdquo; observed the man whom they called captain. &ldquo;Had I taken
      that plan to convince the world of my honesty, I should have been, ten
      years ago, dangling among the scare-crows that ornament Dogs&rsquo; Island.
      Let&rsquo;s hear your story, youngster; you have told too little, or too much&mdash;enough
      to hang you twice over&mdash;so out with the remainder; we&rsquo;re men of
      honour; though, if we swore it, the world would hardly credit, it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no motive to court concealment; to me, life and death were equally
      indifferent. The funner portion of my history I kept to myself, but freely
      narrated the villanous conspiracy of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and his agents, to fix a charge of felony upon me first, and bring me to
      an ignominious end afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of a plant better laid and executed,&rdquo; said the captain, as
      I finished the detail of my last night&rsquo;s adventures. &ldquo;Never was man booked
      safer for the gallows; you had a close escape. Well, &lsquo;touch and go&rsquo; is
      good pilotage, they say&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. I sail for the
      coast of Guinea this evening; we&rsquo;re short-handed; it&rsquo;s a voyage that&rsquo;s not
      much fancied, and I can&rsquo;t persuade men enough to ship. They give a
      cowardly preference to low wages, and no fever; but you have no choice
      between that and hemp, you know. If it&rsquo;s in you, Joe Barton is the man to
      make a sailor of you&mdash;What say ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I embrace your offer cheerfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barton extended his hand, and, with the hold of a vice, grasped mine.
      Then pulling from his pea-coat pocket a canvass bag filled with dollars,
      he counted thirty down, and shoved them across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two months&rsquo; wages in advance. It&rsquo;s a toss-up that you&rsquo;re dead in
      half the time. No matter; I will run the chance&mdash;go with Bob there&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      take you to a slop-seller, who&rsquo;ll fit you out in no time, he&rsquo;ll not refuse
      to join in a stoup afterward. Don&rsquo;t object; it may be the last either of
      you will take in England. Be on board, drunk or sober, at eight; and now
      be off, for I have some matters to attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed the mandate of my new commander, purchased some clothing fitted
      for the sultry climate I was about to visit, joined the vessel before the
      appointed hour, sailed at midnight, and bade a long&mdash;I prayed an
      eternal&mdash;adieu to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached the Downs, having cleared the river safely; and there, I might
      add, that the good fortune of our voyage terminated. Could aught better be
      expected? No; the errand and the agents were infamous alike. We were bound
      to Africa to trade in human flesh, although, professedly, we had left
      England to bring home hard-woods, ivory, and gold-dust. But no honest
      trading was intended; we went out regularly prepared to perpetrate the
      worst cruelty that savage man can fancy when he contemplates deeds of
      crime&mdash;prey on the being that wore God&rsquo;s image&mdash;violate every
      bond of nature, and sever the ties which common humanity holds dearest!
      Speak of the slave-dealer and the highwayman! Pshaw! compare them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I said, that after we lost sight of the shores of England, our
      fortunes proved indifferent, the statement must be qualified. In the first
      object of the voyage we were successful, and carried, in comparative
      safety, a full cargo of slaves to their destination; that is, we managed
      to land <i>alive</i> two-thirds of the wretches we had kidnapped. We
      brought eternal misery with us, and left endless wretchedness behind. But
      already the vengeance of God was upon us&mdash;fever accompanied our
      accursed ship; and, one by one, the villain-crew which originally left
      England died off, and greater villains&mdash;were that possible&mdash;supplied
      the places of the departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of retribution was at hand&mdash;the decree had gone forth&mdash;and
      vengeance was impending on the guilty. We returned to &ldquo;the coast&rdquo;&mdash;as
      that of Africa, in particular, was termed&mdash;shipped a full complement
      of slaves, and once more proceeded on our iniquitous voyage. During ten
      days we made good progress. The captain and his hellish crew, elated with
      apparent success, indulged in ruffian revelry. They drank, and danced, and
      sung; and while despair and death reigned in the crowded hold, the deck
      presented a saturnalia that fiends might have delighted to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the eleventh day that unhallowed revelry ended. The wind dropped
      suddenly&mdash;ominously. In one short hour not a ripple was seen upon the
      sea; and, far as the eye could range, a burning surface of bright blue
      water encircled us. The next sun&mdash;the next&mdash;and yet the next,
      rose and sank, and not a breeze was felt, and not a cat&rsquo;s-paw crept over
      the distant ocean. Ten more passed; and still we drifted idly on the
      glassy surface, like some sea-bird reposing on the deep. Food failed us
      fast&mdash;that was bad; water rapidly diminished&mdash;that was worse.
      The hold became a pest-house. Contagion below produced an increase of
      fever above. The negroes died off by twenties; the crew, one after
      another, disappeared, till, of thirty-six seamen who left the Gambia,
      fourteen alone remained; while half of that small number were so
      debilitated that they could scarcely stand; and the few who still remained
      effective, were quite unequal to that disgusting duty, of disencumbering
      the waist of the human carrion which every hour accumulated. All hope to
      carry any portion of the accursed cargo to its destination was over. The
      dead putrified; the living, maddened by thirst and hunger, had broken
      their chains, and, like rabid animals, could not be approached! One only
      course remained, and the ruffian-crew determined to batten down the
      hatches, fire brimstone underneath the slave-deck, destroy what life
      remained, and make the pest&mdash;a charnel-house!
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was properly chosen for the execution of this diabolical act; and I
      saw the combustibles which were to effect it duly prepared. To witness
      this wholesale murder of two hundred victims was more than I could bear.
      I, who had ever revolted from the horrid vocation of a slave-dealer,
      fancied, that in all which had befallen us, I saw the vengeance of the
      Deity let loose on our accursed bark; and when at midnight I was placed at
      the wheel, and my villanous companions were occupied in murderous
      preparations, from the davits I lowered the only boat could swim, slipped
      over the ship&rsquo;s counter unobserved, and paddled quietly away. In a few
      minutes I was called for&mdash;my evasion was detected&mdash;a dozen
      muskets were discharged after me at random; I heard bullets dip upon the
      water: but I plied my oars vigorously, and in a few minutes was out of
      range.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused, took breath, and looked around. The ship lay in shade, looming
      immensely; all else sea&mdash;sea&mdash;sea! I searched my pockets, and
      found two biscuits; but I was without water! Under a tropic sun, a
      thousand miles from land&mdash;no water! The very thought was enough to
      madden one; but, presently, other feelings banished that horrible
      conviction.

    <p>
      My eyes were turned towards the slaver. Before this, I knew that the
      infernal deed must have been consummated, and that, to protract the lives
      of some dozen guilty wretches, two hundred innocent victims had been
      immolated! A feeble gleam twinkled from the vessel; it faded into
      darkness; and a dull mass, shapeless and colourless, showed me the spot,
      where, upon the waveless ocean the felon-ship lay sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked again. Suddenly, a blaze, as if some inflammable matter had been
      ignited, burst from the slaver and dispelled the darkness. The outline of
      the vessel became distinct; the flame waxed stronger still; every rope and
      sail was visible; and I could perceive figures on the deck, rush to and
      fro, as if in wild disorder. The glare grew redder yet&mdash;the ship was
      in a blaze from stem to stern&mdash;and in their nefarious attempt to
      suffocate their victims, the villains fired the vessel!
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned the boat&rsquo;s head towards the burning ship; and after rowing a
      short distance back, rested on my oars. I knew that if I attempted to near
      the vessel, the skiff would be overcrowded, and all must perish. Shrieks,
      wild and maddening, like those of despairing men, were heard&mdash;every
      inch of canvas which had hung dangling from the yards, was wrapped in
      fire, and the loftiest spars were burning! It was a grand, but terrible
      spectacle; and I strained my eyes to gaze upon it until the red glare
      pained them. At once, a column of brilliant light mounted to the skies,
      followed by a heavy, dull, concussion, which came trembling over the
      water, and rocked my little skiff. A cloud of smoke succeeded. Suddenly
      the light vanished; darkness returned denser than before&mdash;night and
      stillness resumed their silent reign. The magazine had exploded&mdash;and
      the slaver was now buried in the depths of ocean!
    </p>
    <p>
      In tropic climes, night is but a name, and morning broke immediately. I
      gazed over the ocean expanse, as the first glow of sunshine reddened its
      surface, bright and unruffled as a mirror, excepting one small spot ahead,
      which was covered with floating wreck. There, the slaver had gone down,
      and I looked fixedly in that direction. On a scathed beam, I fancied I
      could perceive a human form attached. I rowed to the place. To the
      half-burned portion of the wreck, a fine negro lad was holding with
      desperate tenacity; but he was nearly exhausted, and it was with much
      difficulty I could drag him into the boat. In a few minutes he was
      sufficiently recovered to know that I had rescued him from death, and with
      looks of mute intelligence he seemed to thank me for timely succour. I
      gave him a biscuit; he seized and ate it ravenously. No wonder, poor boy!
      for five long days, food had not passed his lips. With expressive signs he
      intimated that he would hereafter consider himself my slave; and by looks
      of encouragement, in return, I assured him of protection. It was a simple
      contract after all, and made under unusual circumstances; but it has
      lasted, and will last, for life. That negro youth was Dominique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had time to smile at the mockery of a forlorn wretch like myself,
      assuming a momentary superiority over another cast-a-way, saved
      mercilessly from an easier death to perish by the more dreadful agonies of
      thirst and hunger, a light air came stealing over the glassy sea. I looked
      anxiously to windward. Far off, a breeze darkened the blue water, and in
      ten minutes we felt its influence, and our boat danced merrily on the tiny
      waves which curled the ocean for as sight could wander. I felt as if
      Heaven had been appeased, and vengeance satisfied; and hope once more
      replaced the dark despondency to which I had abandoned myself, as one
      whose doom was sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was that cheerful foreboding unfulfilled. Within an hour, and dead to
      windward, a speck appeared upon the edge of the horizon, and seemed, by
      slow degrees, to rise gradually from the ocean, until a goodly ship
      presented itself to the eye; and down she came before a leading breeze,
      with all the canvas set her spars could spread. We lay directly in her
      course. I hoisted a signal on an oar, and it was seen and answered&mdash;for
      presently the stranger took in sail, lowered a boat, sent it to our
      assistance, and &ldquo;I and my man Friday.&rdquo; as worthy Robinson would say, were
      kindly received on board a vessel that proved to be a Portuguese trader,
      bound for the Brazils. My story was readily believed, namely, that our
      ship, an honest merchantman! had accidentally caught fire, and all except
      the negro and myself had perished. No doubt could be entertained of the
      correctness of this statement, for our deliverers had seen the blaze, and
      heard the explosion, when becalmed, at too great distance to render us
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was landed safely in Rio Janeiro, and another epoch in an eventful life
      began. The history of seven years would require too much time to give it
      in detail&mdash;it must be confined to a brief summary. The owner of the
      vessel that had picked me up was a merchant of high respectability. The
      tale of my escape from a burning ship and ultimate starvation, had
      interest, and, pitying my destitution, he offered me a berth in a coasting
      vessel which belonged to him&mdash;I accepted it, and in a few months
      became its captain. I traded for him honestly and successfully, and rose
      by degrees rapidly in his estimation. Every year brought me fresh tokens
      of his confidence and esteem, until at last, I became a partner in his
      business. In every commercial adventure fortune befriended us; and when
      the old man died, and the affairs of his house were finally arranged, I,
      who had landed on the wharf of Rio without a second shirt, found myself a
      merchant of repute, and possessor of thirty thousand dollars. I must add,
      that I had assumed the name of Hartley, and that, during this season of
      good fortune, my faithful negro shared and enjoyed that period of
      treacherous sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, during this prosperous career, I was secretly unhappy. Year after
      year, the English residents returned with the independence they had
      acquired, to die in the land which gave them birth. To me, as I bade them
      an eternal farewell, every departure caused fresh misery, and probed to
      the very quick a wound that none suspected was rankling in my breast. I
      had no country. What was father-land to me? I, a degraded outcast&mdash;stigmatized
      with crime, believed to be a felon and a suicide; and from the memory of
      whose existence, my very father, if living, would recoil. And yet the
      fancy of returning to England haunted me. I thought of it&mdash;dreamed of
      it&mdash;till at last, unable to combat the inclination, I determined, at
      every hazard, to indulge the wish, and revisit the &ldquo;land of my sires,&rdquo;
       were it but to die there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made the necessary preparations to effect my design&mdash;converted my
      property into specie&mdash;secured a passage for myself and faithful
      follower in a vessel bound for England, which, with several others, were
      to start under convoy of a sloop of war. We sailed on the appointed day;
      and, as I then believed, bade an eternal farewell to the shores of South
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was my motive for returning to a land where my name was a disgrace,
      and where he whose feelings towards the offendings of a child are lenient,
      a father&mdash;ay, a father&mdash;would repudiate me with contempt? It was
      to cleanse that name, stained as it was with youthful indiscretions, from
      the plague-spot that human villany had attached to it; and now with the
      command of the means by which justice in England can be secured&mdash;money&mdash;wipe
      away the felon charge which had driven me undeservedly into exile and
      disgrace, and expose the guilty to the world&mdash;ay, though the last
      guinea of a fortune, which years of toil, and danger, and privations, had
      acquired, should be expended to attain the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week our little fleet progressed steadily across the ocean. Old
      merchantmen were then the dullest sailors imaginable; and with every inch
      of canvass we could spread, the sloop of war, with topsails on the cap,
      was frequently obliged to heave to and wait upon our lazy barque. Indeed,
      the vigilance of the convoy-ship was rendered necessary from the
      circumstance of a very suspicious vessel having been discovered for
      several successive mornings at sunrise, following in the wake of the
      fleet, and hauling off whenever she observed that she had been noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth evening, the weather, which had hitherto been remarkably
      fine, threatened a change; and at midnight, the wind had considerably
      freshened. The security of the ship would have pointed out the prudence of
      making preparations for a gale, and putting the vessel under easy canvass;
      while, from the dulness of our sailing, and the certainty that a
      suspicious stranger was in our immediate vicinity, it was absolutely
      necessary that we should keep our place in the fleet, and avail ourselves
      of the man-of-war&rsquo;s protection. In this dilemma it was determined to trust
      to fortune, and &ldquo;carry on.&rdquo; We had certainly, two dangerous alternatives
      to choose between&mdash;threatening weather, and an enemy&rsquo;s privateer. The
      latter fear was predominant; and although every minute skyey appearance
      became more alarming, we still kept a press of canvass on the vessel&mdash;and
      consequently, it was our fate to verify an old saw, in avoiding Seylla, to
      fall into Charybdis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness, a squall struck us suddenly; and before everything could
      be let fly, our three topmasts were over the side, and our worst
      apprehensions were about to be realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a passing gale which had wrought us all this mischief; and when
      morning dawned, the weather had moderated into a light and steady breeze.
      The fleet was out of sight; and we were unable, from the weakness of the
      crew, to clear away at once the wreck of fallen spars and sails that
      cumbered us. We were lying a log upon the water, while our more fortunate
      companions were bowling away before a wind directly in their favour. One
      sail only was in sight, and that was steering in the same direction with
      the convoy. For a time, from being dismasted, we were not discovered by
      the stranger. But suddenly he changed his course, hauled closely to the
      wind, and soon presented to our startled view, the same long, black,
      suspicious-looking brig, which for days before had occasioned a general
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no chance of escape, even had our spars been standing; and in an
      hour the suspected vessel was within musquet range. No doubt of his
      country and calling remained. A French ensign was flying at his peak&mdash;his
      long dark hull showed eleven ports a side&mdash;his decks were crowded,
      and he looked a regular rover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had we a wish to resist, the means were wanting; and at the first hail, a
      boat was lowered, and our captain went on board. In return, two boats,
      filled with armed men, rowed to us from the privateer; the rovers mounted
      our decks, and the work of plunder commenced busily. I had no hope from
      the first, that my property could by any possibility&rsquo; escape detection;
      and a very few minutes put that question at rest. A foreign seaman, whom
      we had shipped at Bio, gave information to the prize-master; and I had the
      misery to see the acquisition of an enter-prizing life pass into the
      possession of the sea-robbers who had captured us.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the disabled condition of the ship, all design of taking her into
      port was abandoned by our captors; but every thing that was portable, even
      to the sea-chests of the crew, was removed on board the brig. The whole
      day was consumed in stripping our luckless vessel; and when at nightfall
      the enemy left us lying still a wreck upon the ocean, I found myself in
      the same condition as when, seven years before, I had landed on the beach
      at Bio&mdash;without a second shirt, a second dollar, or a second friend.
      Of the latter, I possessed a faithful one&mdash;Dominique remained. He had
      resisted every inducement held out by the French captain to join the
      privateer. Poor faithful fellow! when the fickle goddess smiled, he had
      shared my fortune; and adversity had no other effect than to confirm his
      devoted attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the spoilers had taken their departure, nothing but lamentations were
      heard. The humblest mariner had lost his all, the wages he had already
      earned, or the little venture he was bringing home to England, in the
      honest hopes of realizing enough to render a wife or parent comfortable.
      There was but one of that ship&rsquo;s company preserved a sullen indifference;
      I, who had been stripped of more than all together, kept a moody silence,
      and uttered no complaint. All was gone at &ldquo;one fell swoop&rdquo;&mdash;the
      prospect of revisiting my native land&mdash;the hope of clearing my
      calumniated character from the unmerited obloquy whieh designing villains
      had heaped upon it&mdash;the means by which I expected to have effected it&mdash;of
      all, one luckless day had robbed me! The stupid calmness of despair tied
      my tongue, and gave to my countenance an unearthly composure, which many
      might have mistaken for philosophic resignation. But the bosom within was
      tortured&mdash;my&rsquo; sorrow was too great for language to convey; and,
      thunderstruck with the sudden visitation I had undergone, I was debating
      whether it were not at once better to end an existence not to be endured,
      and&mdash;&ldquo;unannealed and unforgiven,&rdquo; in defiance of his canon against
      self-murder,&mdash;venture desperately into the presence of an angry God.
    </p>
    <p>
      These impious thoughts were mercifully terminated. I looked up, an eye was
      bent on mine. It was Dominique&rsquo;s; and the mute expression of that faithful
      negro spoke its deep sympathy for my misfortune, and intimated an eternal
      attachment. A sudden revulsion of intent succeeded the promptings of
      despair. I had lost wealth&mdash;but had I not a friend? A stern
      determination came over me to live and dare Fortune&rsquo;s worst; and when my
      dark follower placed silently a goblet in my hand, I drank the wine to the
      bottom, and swore no matter how darkly fate might frown, she should not
      crush my spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s gone, Dominique. We have no errand now to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro answered with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we commence life anew, and again seek fortune in each other&rsquo;s
      company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand I stretched out the negro pressed to his lips respectfully; and
      with a meaning look, told me that we should sink or rise together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plunder of the ship was followed by a scene of drunken insubordination&mdash;for
      the bad example which the captain set, the crew had followed; and on the
      second evening we were still a wreck upon the water, our top-gear over the
      sides, and none in temper or condition to repair the damage we had
      sustained, and replace our lost spars with jurymasts. On the third morning
      the ship&rsquo;s company had become sufficiently sober to commence a work, that
      should hwe been long before effected&mdash;and I was sleeping in my cabin,
      worn out with the mental suffering I had undergone, when my slumbers were
      gently broken by my sable attendant, to acquaint me that another, and an
      equally dishonest looking vessel, was bearing down upon us fast, and
      barely a league to windward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried upon deck, and a glance confirmed Dominique&rsquo;s announcement. The
      stranger was a large topsail-schooner, with raking masts, a long black
      hull, and Spanish ensign floating from her gaff-end. Her sailing
      properties were admirable; and her whole appearance told that she was
      neither adapted for, nor employed in peaceful commerce. When she rounded
      to under our stern, I counted nine ports aside&mdash;a huge pivot gun was
      on a traverse between her masts, and her decks seemed full of men. She
      could not be mistaken for a moment; she was a rover, a slaver, or a
      privateer, and, probably, all by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old adage * says, that a traveller already disencumbered of his
      property, feels little uneasiness in presence of a highwayman; and
      certainly, to me the appearance of this rakish schooner was a matter of
      perfect indifference. I saw her back her topsail, and take a position that
      placed us &ldquo;end-on,&rdquo; under the fire of her starboard guns. Immediately a
      boat was lowered, and twenty men pulled from her side and boarded us. This
      second visitation, and within eight-and-forty hours, caused but little
      sensation in the ship. All that was valuable was already gone; and the new
      comers must be men of uncommon industry and research, if they could
      discover much that was worth removal. Indeed, the style in which the
      Frenchman had cleared every thing away worth notice, could never be
      surpassed, and proved that in sea robbery his crew had attained
      perfection.

    <p>
      Sad was their disappointment, when our new captors found that they had
      fallen in with a mere bone from which the marrow had been carefully
      extracted. Still, however, there were some necessaries that might prove
      useful; and sails, cordage, water and provisions, were unceremoniously
      conveyed on board the schooner. Presently, a second boat pushed off from
      the rover&rsquo;s side; and it was notified that the captain, in person, was
      coming on board to ascertain how a prize so promising should prove so very
      unproductive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cursed misfortune,&rdquo; said he, in reply to the account his first
      officer gave him of our hwing been thoroughly plundered, and that only
      twenty hours before. &ldquo;By Heven, I am half inclined to make sail after the
      privateer, and make him divide or disgorge the booty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twere idle,&rdquo; said the lieutenant; &ldquo;Heven knows what course he&rsquo;s
      steering. And even if we overtook him, what certainty have we that he
      would not be able to hold his own with us? They say he carried twenty
      guns, and was chokeful of men. He&rsquo;ll dodge the convoy while he dare, and
      trust to accident for a second God-send. No, no&mdash;it was a cursed
      chance, no doubt&mdash;the luck was all John Crapo&rsquo;s&mdash;and no use
      crying over spilt milk, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reasoning of his lieutenant appeared to satisfy his superior, that the
      misfortune he had sustained in coming upon us after the Frenchman&rsquo;s visit
      was irretrievable, and, accordingly, he submitted to it like a Christian
      man; but still he could not avoid making an occasional lament over what he
      termed &ldquo;the blackest of bad luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty thousand dollars&mdash;hard silver&mdash;all one property&mdash;besides
      other most valuable plunder. Was ever ship so unfortunate! But who was the
      unlucky devil who lost the money? Did he drown himself at once, or is he
      still on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant pointed quietly to me; and the captain crossed the deck to
      the place where I was standing, with my arm leaning on the bulwark, as if
      nothing particular had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Sir, I hear you hwe been cleaned out; and, as they tell me, to a
      tolerable tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;can you put me in the way of recovering the loss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said the stranger in surprise; &ldquo;how the devil should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as I am already plucked to the last feather, your honest companions
      have nothing to deprive me of, and you can neither serve nor injure me. Is
      not that a comfort, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my good sir,&rdquo; replied the rover, &ldquo;you need not be so snappish;
      though, &rsquo;pon my soul, the loss of thirty thousand dollars is nothing to
      joke about. But stop; have I ever seen that face before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That question you can best resolve yourself,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;yours has been
      seen by me, I fancy, for the first time; and, let me add, worthy captain,
      I sincerely hope for the last one too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at it a second
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I complied carelessly with the captain&rsquo;s wish, and examined the features
      and figure of this new intruder. The face was swarthy, sunburnt, and had,
      what the Irish happily term, &ldquo;a devil-may-care&rdquo; expression. The person of
      the stranger was square and well-compacted; his dress was composed of
      cotton and nanquin&mdash;textures best suited to the climate. In the
      silken sash which bound his waist, he had secured a watch, a dagger, and a
      brace of pistols; all apparently very valuable. He wore a jewel on his
      finger; diamond rings in either ear, and a gold-laced hat, fit for a
      vice-admiral, completed his showy and singular costume. He was a very
      young man, apparently not more than five-and-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Mr. Jones, or Mr. Thompson, or by whatever name besides you
      called yourself in the Fancy, six years ago upon the coast, now that you
      hwe finished your survey, may I inquire if you can yet recollect an old
      companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started. He had mentioned the slaver&rsquo;s name correctly, and also the
      false appellation by which I was known on board that accursed vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of that slave-ship,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;she foundered at sea, and
      none escaped but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and myself,&rdquo; responded the stranger carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You labour under a mistake, she perished by fire, and none escaped&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you</i>; and how you managed it I don&rsquo;t know. As for me, I gave
      leg-bail in the Gambia. Come, Jones, Thompson, Robinson, or any thing you
      please to call yourself, fear nothing from me. I owe you a debt of
      gratitude. I shipped myself in that villanous slaver, a
      runaway-apprentice; and, when struck down by fever, and dying of thirst
      upon my passage out, the only hand in all that rascally ship&rsquo;s company, to
      whom I was indebted for a drink of water to slake my burning thirst, was
      your&rsquo;s; and now, seven years after, I survive to prove to you that
      kindness to a destitute boy has not been, and shall not be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems you know me,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and concealment would be idle. It is,
      indeed, too true that all on board the slaver perished, save that negro
      who attends me, and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the rover; &ldquo;but you may recollect that a boy was missing the
      night before you sailed. I was that lost one; and, from weariness of a
      miserable life, and disgust at the horrible duty imposed upon me, of
      attending to the slave-hold, every feeling had revolted. I bolted from the
      vessel; escaped a fate that none survived but you; passed through a
      thousand hair-breadth adventures; and now command the Flambeau&mdash;the
      sweetest schooner that ever spread canvass to a breeze. Come, I bear you
      have lost every thing again but life; try your luck once more with Captain
      Raleigh; and rest assured, that he who succoured the fevered boy, shall
      secure the friendship of the commander of the Flambeau,&mdash;a craft by
      some called a privateer, and by others set down&mdash;may Heaven forgive
      them!&mdash;as nothing better than a pirate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened to the rover&rsquo;s invitation. There was much that would induce a
      man, circumstanced as I was, to accept it; I seemed a being marked out for
      misfortune&mdash;for whom no happiness was predestined, and one, for whom
      fate had reserved the phials of her wrath. Captain Raleigh marked my
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;time presses. You brought me, and for little advantage,
      I regret, out of my course this morning, and I must regain it speedily.
      You are, as far as I am concerned, a free agent. Come with me&mdash;you
      will be welcome; stay where you are&mdash;a hundred dollars are at your
      service, to begin the world anew, and the best wishes of the runaway
      apprentice you nursed on his passage to the Gambia. I&rsquo;ll rejoin you in
      five minutes&mdash;a time sufficiently long for a man to come to a
      decision, as well as if he dreamed over it for a twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, walked to another part of the vessel, and gave orders to his
      crew to man their boats, and prepare for returning to the schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dominique had been a silent, but a most attentive observer of my
      tête-à-tête with Captain Raleigh, and I beckoned him to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hour for parting has arrived, Dominique, which, three days since,
      neither you nor I could have anticipated; but so fate wills it. A new and
      perilous career lies before me, the ocean surface must be my home, and its
      deeps shall furnish me a grave. England, the land of freedom, is your
      happier destination. Go, my tried and trusty friend; follow some one of
      brighter fortunes than him you leave; and may your future fate be what
      your attachment and fidelity to me so richly merit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negro did not speak for a few moments&mdash;tears fell first upon the
      deck&mdash;at last, he turned a look of mild inquiry upon my face, and, in
      a broken voice, asked &ldquo;in what he had offended me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was assuring my sable follower how truly I estimated his worth, and how
      deeply I felt the necessity that should deprive me of his services, when
      Captain Raleigh joined us. He held a bag of dollars in his hand. &ldquo;Here&mdash;catch,&rdquo;
       he cried, as he tossed the money to me. &ldquo;And now, &lsquo;to be or not to be, ay,
      that&rsquo;s the question.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s Shakespeare for you. Confound the bard of
      won; &rsquo;twas he that made a rover of me; and but for Hamlet, Prince of
      Denmark, I, Harry Jones, had never been Captain Raleigh, but probably, at
      this blessed hour, a thriving citizen on Ludgate Hill, slicing off
      lutestring for a dowager, or assuring some pretty girl how beautifully the
      last new ribbon harmonized with the colour of her hair. Heigh-ho! I might
      have been happier. Happier! pshaw! nonsense. Yard and shears are only fit
      for woman&rsquo;s hand; this is the tool for man&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;and he touched the
      hilt of his cutlass. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter with your dark companion? Has
      he, too, lost some dollars by the accursed visit of the Frenchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost more&mdash;far more,&rdquo; replied the black, &ldquo;the preserver of my
      life&mdash;the master whom for seven years I followed&mdash;my friend&mdash;my
      benefactor&mdash;him have I lost. He tells me that I must leave him&mdash;leave
      one from whom I thought death alone should separate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you follow his fortunes, and take your chance on board the
      schooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow him!&rdquo; exclaimed the negro; &ldquo;oh, were that allowed, Dominique would
      be too happy.&rdquo; ^
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that honest fist of yours,&rdquo; returned the rover. &ldquo;No matter what
      the colour of the skin may be; the heart&rsquo;s the thing for me. Well, you&rsquo;ll
      take your chance, and seek new fortunes in the Flambeau?&rdquo; he continued,
      addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no other choice,&rdquo; was my reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you have no luggage to remove, I fancy; John Crapo saved you that
      trouble. Jump in; the boat is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed this new director of my destiny; and the whale-boat quitted the
      vessel&rsquo;s side, where, but three short days ago, I was owner of thirty
      thousand dollars, to commence a roving life&mdash;a career of criminal
      adventure&mdash;its close&mdash;at best an ocean grave&mdash;or, what was
      likelier far, the plank, * the yard-arm, or the gibbet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A piratical method of drowning.
</pre>
    <p>
      I shall pass over an epoch of three years, the crowded history of which
      was more than enough to fill the story of a life. Would you know it? ask
      in every Spanish port, from Chili to Panama, what was the Flambeau, and
      who were her commanders? They will tell you, that that pirate barque,
      though for years resting in the caves of the Atlantic, still carries
      terror in her name. They will say, that Raleigh was daring, rash, and
      sanguinary; but that, with the audacious courage of the boldest buccaneer,
      Ramirez was merciful; and that the blood of innocence or old age had never
      stained his hand. Who Raleigh was you know; who Ramirez&mdash;you may
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed since Raleigh had perished in a wild descent upon the
      Spanish Main; and Ramirez, his successor, had assumed a command for which
      his daring and good-fortune had qualified him preeminently. Much wealth
      had been acquired; and it was believed that the Rover Captain had
      transmitted large remittances, in specie and valuables, to Europe. In one
      of the secret inlets with which the Caribees abound, the Flambeau had been
      refitted, provisioned, and made ready for a fresh adventure. The crew were
      all on board, and nothing delayed the schooner&rsquo;s sailing, but the
      unaccountable absence of her commander. A week before he had set out for a
      distant town, to meet a secret agent. The business was speedily
      transacted, and Ramirez had left the city he had visited, to rejoin the
      Rover&rsquo;s crew. Day after day passed; the worst suspicions were entertained&mdash;it
      was believed that he had been assassinated; and a deep gloom spread over
      the whole of the lawless community, who justly regarded Ramirez as the
      ablest commander that ever trod a rover&rsquo;s deck. Many conjectures were
      hazarded; three days elapsed, when a canoe paddled one evening on board
      the Flambeau, and delivered a letter addressed to the second in command,
      in the well-known hand-writing of the captain. In that epistle the mystery
      was cleared away; wonder succeeded apprehension; and wishes so often and
      so warmly breathed by the rover&rsquo;s crew for the safety of their leader,
      were exchanged for imprecations on his head, and deadly vows of
      everlasting vengeance; and one, who was an hour before the idol of that
      lawless band, would have found in every individual who composed it, a
      willing executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could hwe caused this singular change of feeling?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the letter addressed by Ramirez to his lieutenant, he stated that he
      had determined to abandon a roving life for ever, and assured him that
      every attempt to ascertain his motives, or discover his retreat, would be
      equally unwailing. The investment of valuable property on the general
      account of the predatory community had been faithfully executed. He
      promised that every secret connected with his late confederates should be
      buried in his grave&mdash;and the eternal silence of his black companion
      might be equally confided in. The letter concluded with the warmest wishes
      for their future welfare&mdash;with a strong entreaty that they should
      abandon a dangerous career, which, no matter how long fortune smiled upon
      it, must inevitably incur an ignominious termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley paused, and took from his pocket a small sealed packet,
      carefully tied up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; said he, addressing me, &ldquo;the remainder of my sad history would
      be as painful for me to narrate, as you to listen to. In these detached
      papers you will find my chequered and adventurous career faithfully
      outlined. At intervals, &lsquo;few and far between,&rsquo; when I could look back upon
      the past with tolerable composure, these unconnected documents were
      written; and any portions of the tale which may not be sufficiently
      intelligible, your own fancy must fill up. I have not shrunk from being
      the chronicler of my own shame; but I have not nerve or courage to be the
      narrator of suffering so terrible, that reason was unseated, and Heaven
      alone, through gentle agencies, saved me from total despair. Save one&mdash;my
      child&mdash;no other eye has rested on these papers&mdash;none other will;
      for, when you restore them to-morrow, the record of crime and sorrow shall
      perish. Farewell! At dawn of day expect me. Sleep soundly, boy;&mdash;may
      never recollections of the past rob you of rest, as they will me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook my hand, bade me good night, and retired to his chamber; and I,
      burning with curiosity to learn all the particulars of a &ldquo;strange eventful
      history,&rdquo; broke the sealed packet, and read the following details:&mdash;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he city of Quito
      was brilliantly illuminated; it was the anniversary of its patron saint,
      and, in honour of their holy founder, the convent and church of the
      Ursulines presented a spectacle of dazzling splendour. The latter was
      lighted with a thousand tapers, and the great altar was ornamented with
      all the monastic treasures which a devotee delights to view. Crucifixes
      and sacred vessels, in gold and silver, and of surpassing beauty, were
      liberally exhibited; while relics, in jewelled cabinets, were on this, the
      high festival of Saint Ursula, brought from their hallowed shrines, to
      delight the eyes and gladden the hearts of the faithful. A long array of
      dignified ecclesiastics, in gorgeous robes, filed in procession through
      the lofty aisles, while censors blazed, and the pealing organ thundered
      forth its &ldquo;jubilate.&rsquo;&rdquo; Within a large extent round the city, all that was
      noble, wealthy, or religious, on this her glorious anniversary, were
      assembled to do honour to their fwourite saint,&mdash;while salvos of
      artillery from the ramparts, and the rolling fire of <i>feu de joie</i>,
      rose at times above the choral swell, adding to a religious pageant, the
      anomalous associations which a battle-field and &ldquo;heady fight&rdquo; would give.
      To complete the effect of this splendid spectacle, the proud, the brwe,
      the beautiful, followed humbly in procession after monk and nun&mdash;the
      men bearing perfumed tapers of coloured wax&mdash;while the women strewed
      flowers as they moved along before the blessed relics of their sainted
      patroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning against a pillar of the two, two personages of very different
      appearance, viewed the procession with that interest it was so well
      calculated to excite. One, from his quiet air and sober dress, seemed a
      man engaged in some peaceful avocation; he might have been a notary, a
      doctor, or a trader. The other, a young, tall, and handsome cavalier, was
      richly attired in a fanciful costume; rapier and poignard were in an
      embroidered belt; rings of costly workmanship glittered on his fingers,
      and a jewel of exquisite brilliancy sparkled from the looping of his
      richly-plumed hat. As the procession moved slowly on, the gay stranger
      might hwe been overheard addressing his more sober companion, to inquire
      who the actors in the passing scene might be; and while he bent his head
      in differently as every succeeding relic passed, and bishop and mitred
      abbot, one after another, defiled before him, the irreligious stranger
      never asked their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yon stately man in the rich cope and alb is the holy prior of San
      Augustin;&mdash;he exorcises devils&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gay foreigner impatiently interrupted his soberer companion. &ldquo;Hang the
      fat prior!&mdash;we have no devils to be exorcised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see, yonder thin black priest&mdash;he is the canon of San Roque,&mdash;the
      best preacher that ever mounted pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There leave him, my good friend,&mdash;I hate the drowsy race. Ha!&mdash;Who
      is that noble-looking person in the green uniform faced with gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is General Paez. Saints and angels!&mdash;here comes the archbishop
      of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Never mind the archbishop. Who is the silver-headed veteran with the hat
      and scarlet plume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is Admiral Cordova. But the Dominican who bears the banner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the irreligious foreigner broke in. &ldquo;Confound them both! bearer and
      banner. Look, man!&rdquo;&mdash;as another, and the fairest portion of the
      procession, walked slowly past the pillar, strewing flowers as they moved
      along. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;that sylph-like girl, with blue eyes, is
      worth all the monks and cardinals who ever said an ave, or carried a
      blessed candle. But see!&mdash;mark you that lovely girl in silvered
      satin?&mdash;she with the ebon locks, and downcast eyes. How beautiful is
      that air&mdash;the easy movement of her walk&mdash;the grace with which
      each flower drops from her hand! I must not, dare not look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twere better not,&rdquo; remarked the soberer of the twain; &ldquo;she is for the
      last time in worldly company: in another week she enters the convent of
      Saint Agatha, and she will be professed immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professed!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion,&mdash;&ldquo;what means that? But see&mdash;the
      procession halts!&rdquo; and at the moment, the beautiful <i>religieuse</i>
      stopped at the base of the very pillar against which the gay stranger had
      taken his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that sweet girl?&rdquo; said the latter, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden halting of the long array caused the fair flower-bearer to look
      up, and her eyes encountered those of the stranger which were turned upon
      her in breathless admiration. The beautiful devotee coloured to the brows,
      and again her eyes dropped upon the tesselated pavement. It was probably
      from agitation that a small bouquet, composed of the most delicate flowers
      which a tropic clime produces, fell unconsciously from her hand, when,
      unperceived by any but the lovely <i>religieuse</i> and his own companion,
      the stranger picked it up, pressed it for a moment with ardour to his
      lips, and then carefully deposited the floral treasure in his bosom. Again
      the procession moved, the beauteous devotee exchanged a passing glance;
      and if it were intended to reprove the boldness of the daring adventurer,
      or express sorrow at the loss of her fragrant bouquet, neither feeling was
      conveyed, for the look was the sweetest one imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now by every saint upon the calendar, and the list is longer than the
      muster-bill of a line-of-battle ship, it&rsquo;s all over with me&mdash;I&rsquo;m lost&mdash;destroyed&mdash;undone.
      Who is that angel in woman&rsquo;s form? Speak!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger,
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The loveliest girl in Grenada,&rdquo; returned his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! tell me not what I know already&mdash;but her name? her family?
      Come, out with all you know, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; replied the civilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; returned his friend, &ldquo;tell me anything connected with that
      charming devotee, and I&rsquo;ll listen although the tale lasted to eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; replied the other,&mdash;and he whispered the title by which he
      addressed him softly in his gay companion&rsquo;s ear,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;ware love!&mdash;Cupid
      himself would find no welcome on board a vessel called the Flambeau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with the story!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger; &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll break through the
      procession, and ask it of the sweet girl herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the civilian, with a smile, &ldquo;to keep you clear of the
      Inquisition for an insult to a fwourite saint like blessed Agatha, I will
      tell you all I know. Sit down upon this marble pediment, and we can speak
      without any one hearing us. Marked you the greyheaded commander, dressed
      in a blue uniform, with two crosses at his breast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I did: the worn-out admiral who bore a candle in the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the taper is fitter than the sword for the hand of age to carry; no
      doubt, many a day since, the old gentleman has been laid up in ordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be anything but flattered could he but overhear our
      conversation,&rdquo; continued the companion of the gay stranger. &ldquo;In ordinary!
      Not he, faith!&mdash;It is barely six months ago since he married the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Widow of some gouty general,&rdquo; exclaimed the other, impatiently. &ldquo;Pshaw!&mdash;no
      more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He married,&rdquo; responded the civilian, &ldquo;no widow of a gouty general, but
      Inez de Liomana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An antiquated virgin,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a smile; &ldquo;of high family,
      holy life, and on the wrong side of sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never did a man guess wider of the mark: she was one of the prettiest
      girls in the province, and on the right side of seventeen,&rdquo; observed the
      civilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the devil does it interest me,&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, &ldquo;whether
      an old gentleman exhibits his dotage, by committing matrimony, or any
      other similar absurdity? I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wish me to favour you with full particulars touching his lovely
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter!&rdquo; said the stranger: &ldquo;Is yonder peerless beauty indeed that
      old man&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His only child. She pays the penalty of an act of dotage, for the old
      fool&rsquo;s marriage consigns her to a convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monstrous!&rdquo; ejaculated the stranger: &ldquo;What! bury beauty like her&rsquo;s within
      a living grave! By Heaven! I&rsquo;ll escalade the convent walls myself, and
      liberate that lovely victim; ay, though I perished by the hands of the
      Inquisition for the sacrilege! But why, if the old man played the fool,
      should she, poor girl, be immured for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To gratify the selfish vanity of a weak old dupe. Inez was the orphan
      daughter of a poor knight of San Iago; and on her father&rsquo;s death, without
      friends or fortune, she was destined to take the veil. Educated at the
      same convent with the heiress of the admiral, she came to visit her young
      companion before the vows should be pronounced, that would sever her for
      ever from society. The old man saw her, and, struck with her beauty,
      fancied that he loved. He told his tale of folly. Inez detested the
      seclusion which awaited her. A splendid home&mdash;a life of luxury&mdash;the
      name of wife&mdash;a lover&mdash;coupled with a title, were offered and
      accepted. Inez is vain and ostentatious, and a sudden rise from humble
      orphanage, has almost turned her brain. She indulges in every
      extravagance, and the doting admiral, they say, yields to every
      solicitation, no matter how expensive; and thus a fortune, sufficient to
      support the rank and establishment of a grandee, has been found inadequate
      to meet the profusion his silly marriage has entailed; and to gratify the
      extravagance of his youthful consort, the old dupe has determined that his
      only child shall be sacrificed, to enable him to meet the extra demands
      made upon his purse, by the capricious girl whom he has been weak enough
      to marry. And now, Captain Ramirez, you know as much as I do of every
      thing connected with the lovely <i>religieuse</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; returned the stranger, passionately, &ldquo;friend Sanchez, I will
      know more, or the fault shall not be mine. But see&mdash;the procession is
      about to move. Whither will these fat drones steer to now? Stand fast;
      they&rsquo;ll pass again. I would not lose the chance of another angel-glance of
      yon dark eye, for this brilliant in my hat; and the water is the purest in
      Grenada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would you give me, could I procure you an interview? Ay,
      captain, stare not so incredulously; an interview!&mdash;not exactly
      tête-à-tête; but in the presence only of a youthful step-dame, and myself,
      your very humble servant,&rdquo; said the civilian, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger; &ldquo;change your query, Signor Sanchez, and
      rather inquire, what would I not give. Pshaw! the thing&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you wager one hundred dollars on the event?&rdquo; inquired the Captain&rsquo;s
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the stranger; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet you three to one, and in
      hundreds too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>done</i>. The wager&rsquo;s made. Prepare your money, Master Sanchez.
      Were it but for exciting false hopes, every dollar shall be exacted,
      whether they be begged, borrowed, or stolen. But, saints and angels! here
      she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the long array filed past in solemn mardi; and a less devout
      spectator could not have been discovered in the crowded assemblage than
      Captain Ramirez. The archbishop of Moldivia glided on in stately dignity;
      and the stranger regarded the haughty prelate with as little veneration as
      the neophyte who waved a perfumed censer in his rear. On came the thin
      black canon of San Roque; and the ablest preacher in the province elicited
      no more notice. In fact, two objects engrossed the gallant captain&rsquo;s
      attention&mdash;one was the old admiral with the yellow taper; and the
      other that lovely devotee, his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed the pillar closely as before. To the stranger, the crowded
      procession contained a single object, and his ardent gaze sought that one
      only in the throng. She came; for a moment she raised her soft and
      speaking eyes,&mdash;they met those of the stranger. He took the flowers
      from his bosom&mdash;pressed them to his lips. The fair devotee observed
      the act; and the glance that answered it, would not induce a lover to
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Captain Ramirez, as the ceremony ended, and the numerous
      spectators issued from the church, &ldquo;if ever man were fairly ruined, I am
      he. Friend Sanchez, how gladly would I tell thee out three hundred
      dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the civilian; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to assure you, that that pleasure
      is reserved for to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would I dare think it so,&rdquo; said the captain, with a sigh; &ldquo;but how is it
      to be done? Are we to pick locks, scale walls, commit-murder, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; returned Signor Sanchez; &ldquo;we will effect it by no
      felonious means, or I shall agree to forego the benefit of the wager. Rest
      assured, that the entry into the admiral&rsquo;s domicile shall be peacefully
      achieved. Come, supper will be waiting; we will finish afterwards a flask
      or two to the health of the peerless Camilla; and, it by the hour of
      siesta to-morrow, I have not lightened your purse by three hundred pieces,
      why, worthy captain, then write Juan Sanchez down a very ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morning came. The gay stranger was early a-foot; for, were the truth told,
      the sweet <i>religieuse</i> had spoiled the captain&rsquo;s sleep. Presently his
      host joined him. The morning meal was discussed; and the stranger reminded
      Signor Sanchez that he had net forgotten the wager made on the preceding
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry if you had, noble captain, for it would be to me the
      loss of a sum in sterling silver, that we traders do not every day realize
      so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friend, when is the trial to come off?&rdquo; was the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bet shall be speedily decided; and, in one hour hence, the pocket of
      one of us will be lighter than it is at present: I could give a shrewd
      guess, Captain Ramirez, which of them it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half the time wore away, when the essay was to be made; and the stranger
      became momentarily more impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you may prepare,&rdquo; said the civilian, &ldquo;for your interview with
      Camilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What preparations are necessary?&rdquo; inquired the stranger; &ldquo;my hat and
      sword are on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where they shall peaceably await our return. You must adopt a more
      respectable appearance. Doth these gay trappings; and, for the occasion,
      pass as my assistant. There is a modest-looking dress at your service, in
      the next room; and when you have put it on, the box you are to carry will
      be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the change of costume was completed. Don Juan Sanchez set
      out for the admiral&rsquo;s residence, with a jewel-case under his arm, and
      Captain Ramirez, attired like a sober citizen&rsquo;s attendant, followed
      dutifully with another, largely stocked with artificial flowers, and
      divers other articles which interest the fair sex. They reached Don
      Manuel&rsquo;s residence, in the Plaza; and the moment Sanchez and his assistant
      presented themselves, they were freely admitted, and conducted to a
      waiting-room, until their arrival should be formally announced to the
      consort of the commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the civilian, in a whisper, &ldquo;how many dollars would you
      give to be off? Your wager&rsquo;s lost. Well, take some from me, and I promise
      you a glorious opportunity. I am the bearer of an emerald necklace&mdash;the
      young wife will be sufficiently occupied in its examination: and could you
      not, in the interim, dispose of some of your wares to the old man&rsquo;s
      daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, I&rsquo;ll try. But, honest Sanchez, I fear I can manage the retail
      business but indifferently. I&rsquo;m in the wholesale line, you know. Here
      comes the lady&rsquo;s page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A richly-dressed negro-boy summoned the civilian and his companion to the
      presence of Dona Inez. They found her in a magnificent apartment, resting
      in luxurious indolence upon a splendid couch, while the lovely devotee was
      arranging some beautiful flowers in a crystal vase, in another corner of
      the chamber. Sanchez bowed with deferential humility to the haughty
      beauty; a civility she scarcely returned; and then, advancing to the sofa,
      he presented a casket, with its brilliant contents, for the inspection of
      the lofty Doha.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the attention of the consort of the admiral was enthralled
      with the jewellery that this costly casket presented, and frequent
      exclamations of her admiration told how ardently she responded to the
      commendations of the merchant, as he pointed out the beauty of every gem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pedro,&rdquo; said the civilian, &ldquo;show that box of mine to yonder lady.
      Flowers, merely, your excellenza; fit only for young ladies about to be
      professed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The companion of Juan Sanchez instantly obeyed the order of his superior;
      and, crossing the apartment, disclosed the treasure&rsquo;s of his box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flowers are pretty,&rdquo; said the beautiful Camilla with a sigh, &ldquo;but I
      do not require any. They tell me there are enough in the garden of the
      convent. Heigh-ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wreath, lady, is reckoned beautiful,&rdquo;&mdash;and the companion of
      Juan Sanchez selected what lie considered the most valuable of the
      collection. &ldquo;Would you deign to accept&mdash;no, no, I mean, would you
      oblige me by buying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fair Camilla gracefully declined the purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that&mdash;or this one; any&mdash;all.&rdquo; There never was a more
      importunate flower-dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied the lady, gently, &ldquo;indeed there is nothing here that
      I require. You mistake me; I am destined for a life that forbids all
      mortal luxuries. Show these things&mdash;and, indeed, some of them are
      very beautiful&mdash;to yonder lady, my father&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, the
      name was not a pleasant one to pronounce&mdash;&ldquo;<i>she</i> will probably
      buy them. I do not need them; and if I did&mdash;but no&mdash;down, down,
      proud heart&mdash;&rdquo; and she turned aside to hide a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, lady, accept them; and, in return, repay me with your prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intended novice waved her hand, and moved a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, lady; stay for one moment. I have a flower here, an empress could
      not purchase; let me, pray let me, show it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the fair girl, as she turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too precious to entrust within this casket, and therefore I
      enshrine it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the stranger took from his bosom a bunch of flowers, and
      placed them in Camilla&rsquo;s hand. Instantly a burning blush rose to her very
      brows. A few rapid sentences fell from the stranger&rsquo;s lips; a billet was
      placed softly in no unwilling hand; when the entrance of the admiral
      disturbed the course ot love and traffic in which the civilian, and his
      excellent companion, were so busily engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not ask him for so much money to-day,&rdquo; said Dona Inez, in a
      whisper; &ldquo;but promise me to keep the jewels until Friday, and then come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obsequious merchant gave the necessary pledge, and, followed by his
      attendant, he made an &ldquo;humble obeisance,&rdquo; and quitted the mansion of Don
      Manuel de Cordova.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday came. Again the visit was repeated: other brilliants had been
      added, in the interim, to the rich display that Juan Sanchez had
      previously exhibited; and the stranger&rsquo;s flowers had been replaced with
      others of rarer kinds, and more exquisite fragrance. No wonder, therefore,
      that both collections were examined with an increased interest; and, in
      the wife and daughter of the admiral, that each found an ardent admirer.
      At the especial request of the former lady, the final selection of
      jewellery was postponed until the following Monday. Camilla was then to
      spend that her last day with the world; for the next day was to witness
      her private reception into the convent of Saint Agatha, to prepare herself
      for the formalities of an immediate profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday came, and the diamond-merchant presented himself punctually at Don
      Manuel&rsquo;s door. He was alone, and his friend the flower-dealer no longer
      accompanied him. He knocked, but admission was refused; and the porter
      informed him, that his lady declined that day receiving any visitors.
      There was a strange confusion visible through the whole of the admiral&rsquo;s
      establishment; and servants hurried to and fro, with an anxiety apparent
      in their looks, like that of men to whom some surprising occurrence had
      been recently made known. In a few hours, the cause of this commotion was
      whispered over the city, and created universal astonishment. The admiral&rsquo;s
      fair daughter, Camilla, who in a few days was to have become the betrothed
      of Heaven, had, on the preceding night, eloped from her father&rsquo;s mansion,
      and not a trace of the beautiful fugitive eould be discovered. The day
      passed, and no tidings were heard of the lost one: and the most extensive
      inquiries produced but little information. It was ascertained that a
      fishing-canoe had observed a felucca cross the bar, and, at an unusual
      time of tide, stand out to sea&mdash;and a stranger, whose brilliant
      appearance occasioned a sensation in the city, had suddenly departed from
      the hotel where he lodged, accompanied by his black domestic. Months
      succeeded days&mdash;Camilla was never heard of; and many and marvellous
      were the surmises as to the means and manner, by which the lovely daughter
      of Don Manuel de Cordova had been so mysteriously spirited away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years slipped away. Don Manuel de Cordova was gathered to his
      fathers; and after the briefest period of mourning, which a decent respect
      to the memory of one who had bequeathed her his whole fortune, would
      allow, the young relict had bestowed her widowed hand on a wild and
      dissipated grandee. Of the lost Camilla no tidings were ever heard, and
      her strange disappearance remained as much a mystery as it was on the
      morning after it occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another event had caused immense joy along the coast. A celebrated rover,
      which for years had infested the neighbouring seas, had been driven on
      shore and destroyed by an English cruiser. Indeed it was full time that
      the Flambeau&rsquo;s predatory career should be terminated. While she had
      continued under the command of a person who called himself Ramirez, her
      spoliations were restricted to what is considered allowable to vessels
      occupied in free trading, and no acts of violence had ever been permitted.
      But for some unknown cause that captain had mysteriously disappeared, and
      under his successor, the rover became a regular pirate; and, from the
      extent of her depredations, her destruction became indispensable. In
      effecting this, most of her lawless crew had fallen, and the remainder
      were driven into the woods, where, as it was hoped and expected, they
      would be speedily arrested and brought to that justice which so long they
      had managed to evade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of those sweet glades which are found occasionally in the pathless
      forests of the south, aud show, amid the interminable extent of dank weeds
      and underwood by which they are environed, like an oasis in the desert,
      the summer residence of a wealthy planter had been erected. The front
      verandah of the building opened on a piece of open land, which stretched
      its green and velvet-looking surface gently downwards, until it rested on
      the bank of one of those deep inlets which debouch into the mighty rivers
      that intersect the southern portion of America; while the rear of this
      romantic retreat was overhung by woods composed of the noblest trees the
      earth produces, and in every variety of tint and foliage. The house itself
      was of slight construction, and designed only for temporary habitation;
      for, like other proprietors of opulence, the owner possessed a splendid
      mansion in a seaport some fifty leagues lower down the river; a place
      better suited, both from comfort and society, to form a permanent
      residence; and his visits to this distant estate were merely for the
      purpose of superintending a numerous gang of negroes engaged in felling
      hard woods, and in enjoying the amusements of hunting and shooting, which
      boundless forests and prairies abundantly afforded. All in and about this
      rustic abode evidenced both wealth and taste, and presented every elegance
      and luxury that was adapted to a tropic climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm and lovely night; the musquito curtains were closed, and in
      a very elegant saloon the owner of this sporting-lodge and his family
      might hwe been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweeter scene of domestic repose could never hwe been selected by a
      painter than the group within exhibited. A man, stout, handsome, and in
      the flower of life, had his dark eyes fixed, with pride mingled with
      affection, upon a female younger than himself by at least a dozen years.
      Nothing could be lovelier than the beautiful countenance he looked upon,
      as hanging over a sleeping child that rested in her lap, a mother&rsquo;s looks
      of love were bent upon her slumbering treasure. Behind the lady&rsquo;s chair, a
      tall finely-proportioned negro was standing with a silver salver, on which
      were fruits and wine; while a beautiful Chilleno girl waited at her
      mistress&rsquo; side, to receive her sleeping charge. Presently the infant was
      committed to its nurse&rsquo;s arms. The negro placed his refreshments on the
      table, and, with the fair Chilleno, immediately quitted the apartment,
      leaving the planter and his lovely wife to the society of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose and looked out from the lattice on the lawn, and as she
      crossed the chamber the grace of her figure was displayed. It boasted no
      longer the airy elegance of girlish symmetry: the flower was in its bloom&mdash;the
      form exhibited womanly maturity; and it was apparent that her&rsquo;s was that
      endearing situation, which doubly claims a husband&rsquo;s tenderest care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening had changed to midnight; not a breath of wind rustled the lewes,
      or rippled the glassy surface of the river. All were asleep but the
      guilty; and yet, at that lone hour, a group of men were circled round a
      fire beside a sandy cove, on which a boat was drawn ashore. They were all
      armed; and while some were preparing supper, others kept a vigilant look
      out. They had the air and appearance of wild and desperate men; and their
      conversation, maintained in that low tone which evinces suspicion,
      confirmed their lawless character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an infernal accident,&rdquo; said one of the rovers, &ldquo;to run her smack
      upon a sunken rock, and lose the vessel after boasting that he knew every
      creek and cove from Chiloe to Cape Francisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never lose another,&rdquo; observed a second scoundrel, coolly. &ldquo;But
      Gaspard is over ready with his pistol. Before the schooner&rsquo;s copper had
      scraped the coral a second time, Diego was dead as a mackarel. Poor devil!&mdash;the
      skipper allowed no time for explanations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and the captain was right,&rdquo; observed a truculent ruffian, whose
      features were scarcely visible from the matted covering of coal-black
      hair, which hid them from chin to forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half sorry, too, that we
      lost the blundering fool&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t mean it after all. There&rsquo;s but a
      handful of the old Flambeaus left, and one now-a-days can&rsquo;t trust to
      strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lucky craft that old Flambeau was,&rdquo; said the first speaker: &ldquo;her
      equal for success, in Captain Ramirez&rsquo; time, was never known. And then he
      kept all so nicely out of trouble; and though men grumbled at him now and
      then, why, in the long-run, he proved a wise-one. He valued no flag but
      one; and a yard of British bunting was a vessel&rsquo;s full security. If we met
      an English trader short of water, why he supplied it freely; were
      provisions wanted, he put us on short allowance, and divided to the last
      biscuit with the starving crew. Well, the first ship&mdash;French, Dutch,
      or Spaniard, Portuguese or Dane&mdash;we met with afterwards, he made up
      the loss&mdash;ay, and helped himself to a double quantity, because he had
      succoured the distressed. Well, the foreigner probably complained to the
      first broad pennant, when he reached a harbour, when in dropped a disabled
      ship to tell that in her distress she had got all she wanted from the
      Flambeau. Had the gallant Ramirez remained, the finest schooner that ever
      crossed the line would be as she used to be, breasting the waters like a
      sea-gull. See what fell out: Gaspard couldn&rsquo;t stand temptation, but must
      fall foul of a rich Jamaica-man,&mdash;and in a month a clipper sloop is
      dispatched to regularly run us down; and sticks to us like a bloodhound,
      until, like our namesake, we were regularly extinguished. Ah! poor
      Flambeau!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true. We never knew the old captain&rsquo;s loss, till after we had
      got a new one; and many&rsquo;s the time Gaspard has heard that told him, when
      he didn&rsquo;t like it. But where has he wandered to? He&rsquo;s full an hour away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not lost, however; for see, he comes along the cove.&rdquo; Of all that
      lawless company, assembled round a midnight fire, the new comer looked the
      greatest ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now,&rdquo; he said, assuming an air and tone of command, &ldquo;is supper ready
      yet? There&rsquo;s no great cooking required, Master Sambo,&rdquo; said he, addressing
      a mulatto who appeared to be the cook; &ldquo;scanty fare at present, lads&mdash;fish,
      fish, fish! No matter; better luck again. Come, let&rsquo;s have it as it is.
      Step to the boat, Soto, and bring us that runlet of Hollands. Curses on
      that stupid scoundrel, who, with plenty of sea room and smooth water, lost
      a vessel so foolishly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He paid for his mistake upon the spot: you&rsquo;re clear with him, captain,&rdquo;
       growled another ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, were he my brother, he should have fared no better. But, come, my
      lads, eat, drink, and bless the saints afterwards, for giving you the
      commander you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said another rover, &ldquo;we could rather persuade them to mend our
      fare a little. Nothing but river fish&mdash;one worse than another, and
      the best not fit for a nigger&rsquo;s banyan day. I fancy we&rsquo;ll fare still
      worse; the vessel gone, and not a chance of getting another! What the
      devil could have brought us here? Toiling at the oars for a hundred miles
      up a river, where nothing could be met with but timber rafting down the
      stream. Pish! a pretty way to lose a schooner. I say, what drove us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; returned the other, in a mutinous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge!&rdquo; was the stern reply; &ldquo;revenge and plunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge sounds well enough,&rdquo; returned the former speaker, &ldquo;and plunder
      better still. But on whom have we any cause of vengeance, fifty leagues
      from ocean? &lsquo;Who are we to find here, among mango trees and cockatoos? And
      as to plunder, there&rsquo;s nothing to be picked up but drift wood; and there&rsquo;s
      a chance&mdash;-a raft floating down the river, and only a brace of
      niggers guarding it!&rdquo; and the fellow laughed in derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; roared the captain, sternly. &ldquo;Pass the runlet; and at its third
      round, I&rsquo;ll tell you why we came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dutch courage required to-night, captain, that we must be drunk, or
      half-seas over, before you tell us what brought us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven! Juan, you will drive me further than I wish,&rdquo; and the captain
      laid his hand upon a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold! hold!&rdquo; exclaimed half-a-dozen voices; &ldquo;no more of that to-night. No
      use in mincing matters; the schooner&rsquo;s sunk, and what are we to do?&mdash;keep
      here, and rob fishing canoes, as we did to-night, to furnish out a
      rascally existence? or seek the bush at once, and band ourselves with
      nigger runaways? Captain, it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, men,&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, passionately. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis true the
      vessel&rsquo;s gone: well, that&rsquo;s no fault of mine; but for the plan&mdash;revenge
      and plunder. Don&rsquo;t they sound well together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; said a rover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all remember Ramirez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; was generally responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An outbreak from the band prevented the captain from finishing the
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramirez,&rdquo; said the man whose face was ensconced in hair, &ldquo;was the best
      commander that I&mdash;and I&rsquo;m twelve years in the free trade&mdash;ever
      sailed under; ay, or ever will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In action, cool as a cucumber,&rdquo; rejoined a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added a third, &ldquo;in real danger, fierce as a wild cat; and with all
      his wits about him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night nor day, I never saw him disguised in liquor,&rdquo; observed another,
      who was so particularly drunk, that he could barely articulate. &ldquo;You might
      trust him with uncounted gold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to his ship&rsquo;s company,&rdquo; added a sixth, winding up the eulogium, &ldquo;he
      was true as needle to the north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, comrades,&rdquo; said the captain, moodily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow that Ramirez was
      a good commander, an able seaman, stout leader, capital hand at a pinch,
      slept always with his starboard eye open; but he was&mdash;&rdquo; and he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The falsest villain that ever betrayed a gallant crew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; was repeated by a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you proof positive. He disappeared; but none of you could tell,
      or even guess, the wealth he carried with him. None suspected him; for all
      of you thought him a nonesuch. Well, what was he all along? why, nothing
      more nor less than a hired spy. He gave the cruisers secret information of
      all that passed in every port we entered as free traders; and, in return,
      they never looked after him. Well, he got blown on the coast at last; and,
      when he could no longer carry on the game, he left the Flambeau to her
      fate. And how long after he had deserted ship and comrades was it before
      the British bull-dogs were let loose upon the sweetest schooner that ever
      swam the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, captain,&rdquo; observed a rover, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all well enough; but
      recollect, that in the time of Captain Ramirez, men never walked the
      plank; nor did he, like a common ass, make free with English bunting, and
      put his hand upon the lion&rsquo;s mane. If a doubtful sail appeared in the
      gulph, why an English merchantman would run under the Flambeau&rsquo;s stern for
      protection; and, there&rsquo;s no use talking, Captain Ramirez stood so high
      with every skipper in these seas, that, d&mdash;&mdash;n me, were he
      sentenced to be hanged, I think they&rsquo;d hardly get men enough in a whole
      ship&rsquo;s company, to man the fall that sent him to the fore-yard. No, no; he
      never intentionally left the schooner. Poor dear soul!&mdash;he was
      murdered, and that&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen voices answered in a willing affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolts and madmen!&rdquo; shouted the captain; &ldquo;he lives! ay, lives! Why stare
      ye thus, like fools?&mdash;Ay, lives in luxury and splendour: the richest
      planter in the province; the highest among the high; and all bought by
      what?&mdash;falsehood, and deep, deep treachery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the rovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, by the light of heaven!&rdquo; returned the pirate chief. &ldquo;He lives; ay,
      and is sleeping at his ease&mdash;wealth around him, and beauty in his
      arms&mdash;not half a league from the very spot I stand on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Ramirez alive, and wealthy, and within cannon-shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Captain Ramirez be not, there&rsquo;s one that will answer just as well,
      although he has dropped a former title, and taken the plainer one of
      Hartley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, captain, no riddles, if you please; we&rsquo;re plain seamen, and can
      only understand a plain story. If Ramirez is alive, and as you have
      described him, why, all you said against him must be true. Men neither
      come back from the grwe, nor do they pick up doubloons in the woods, like
      hiccory nuts. If your tale be true, Ramirez is a traitor and a rogue; and,
      were there no other hand to do the job, I&rsquo;d row a hundred leagues for the
      mere pleasure of cutting the throat of scoundrel that sold us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juan, the right pluck is in thee still,&rdquo; returned Gaspard, with a smile
      of demoniac satisfaction. &ldquo;What say ye all, lads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that he who wouldn&rsquo;t do as honest Juan says, has no manhood in him,&rdquo;
       responded a rover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, pass the good liquor round, and then for booty and revenge!&rdquo; From
      hand to hand the runlet passed, until the contents were drained to the
      very bottom. Maddened by ardent spirits, burning under the belief of
      having been betrayed, and excited by the hope of plunder, the ferocious
      band prepared for violence and bloodshed. Their arms were examined; the
      simple plan of attack explained by the ruffian leader, who had already
      reconnoitred the dwelling of his intended victim; the boat was carefully
      drawn up, and hidden in the tall reeds which fringed the river&rsquo;s bank;
      water carried from the stream, and flung on the red embers of the fire;
      and, in Indian files, one after another, the ruffians took a narrow path
      cut through the tangled underwood, and followed their truculent commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did no eye, save that which looks alike on innocence and guilt, observe
      them? Yes; the slwe, whose canoe they had despoiled, directed by the fire,
      had traced the marauders, and, concealed in the thick brushwood, overheard
      their plans of murder. While making their final preparations, the negro
      glided through the coppice like a snake, and ran, at headlong speed, to
      alarm his devoted master. He reached the dwelling safely; but it was to
      alarm, and not to save!
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter&rsquo;s country-house was wrapped in night and silence; the lights
      were extinguished, and the inmates buried in deep repose. From the lord to
      the serf, all felt the influence of that peaceful hour; and in the woods
      where he had toiled all day, the negro slept in his wigwam as soundly as
      his master; for, as the Indian adage goes,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The lightest heart has ever the heaviest eye-lid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At that still hour, a dusky figure stole underneath the verandah of the
      planter&rsquo;s house, and sought a window in the rear. Twice, he tapped gently
      on the lattice; the third time, the sound was sharper&mdash;and it was
      heard and answered. To a person within, the negro communicated some
      intelligence, and the next moment a door was cautiously unclosed, and the
      late visitor admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the tidings were, which this untimely messenger had brought, they
      seemed to have created an unusual sensation. From window to window lights
      flashed rapidly, and human figures flitted to and fro. But the alarm as
      speedily subsided; the lights disappeared; and darkness, denser apparently
      than before, returned; and the ominous silence that succeeded, rendered
      the recent hurry the more remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval of this singular repose was brief&mdash;it was but a
      treacherous calm. Armed men issued quietly from the cover of the woods,
      and, halting at a little distance from the sleeping house, they held a
      rapid consultation. Presently, dividing into two bodies, they approached
      the planter&rsquo;s dwelling. One moved stealthily to the front&mdash;the other
      as cautiously stole round the rear. The marauders calculated upon
      effecting a surprise, but the negro fisherman had warned the inmates of
      their danger; and on the first attempt to force an entrance, a double
      discharge from a lower-lattice stretched two of the assailants on the
      ground; while, in the rear, the attack proved equally disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might hwe been expected, that, astounded at a sanguinary and unexpected
      repulse, the villains would have abandoned their design. But, desperate
      men, they brought with them desperate means, and, at the order of their
      leader, they flung lighted combustibles into the thatch which covered the
      edifice; and retiring for shelter behind the nearest trees, maintained a
      fusilade upon the house, and waited with demoniac patience the rapid
      progress of fire&mdash;their terrible auxiliary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the roof was in a blaze, and the upper story, constructed
      entirely of wood-work, caught fire. Coolly the murderous ruffians watched
      the flames as they enveloped the edifice from front to rear; and assured
      of the result, they watched the crisis with fiendish pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came:&mdash;all&mdash;above, below&mdash;the building was sheeted in
      fire. Suddenly, the negroes broke out from the blazing pile, and rushed
      towards the woods for safety. Two male slaves were instantly shot down&mdash;the
      others effected their escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, lads, look sharp,&rdquo; roared the demon leader of the gang; &ldquo;the traitor
      will bolt immediately. No mercy for Ramirez!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely uttered before a white man, only half-dressed, and
      bearing a female in his arms, sprang from the burning ruins, followed
      closely by a tall powerful negro, with a bundle grasped by his left arm,
      and a cutlas flaming in his right hand. The leader dashed past the trees
      where the murderers had taken their stand, at headlong speed, apparently
      as little embarrassed with the female form he carried, as if his burden
      were an infant. The negro kept directly in his master&rsquo;s rear. A yell
      arose: half a dozen shots were discharged&mdash;but not a bullet found its
      mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven! the villain will escape us!&rdquo; roared the pirate-captain,
      rushing from his concealment in pursuit. Another of the gang had already
      crossed his path, but the fugitive discharged a pistol, and shot the
      assailant dead. The occurrence caused a moment&rsquo;s delay. It was a fatal
      one: for Gaspard overtook his intended victim, and struck fiercely at him
      with a dagger. It missed the heart it aimed at, but found a sheath in the
      bosom of her whom the fugitive supported; and before a surer blow could be
      delivered, with one trenchant sweep the negro&rsquo;s cutlass cleft the villain
      to the chin. The wood was gained&mdash;the fugitive believing that he held
      a living body in his arms! Alas! that precious burden was only a
      breathless corpse!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last effort of the murderers. A gang of wood-cutters, alarmed
      by the blaze and firing, had hurried to their master&rsquo;s domicile, while the
      murderous crew, eight in number, retreated to the woods; and for that
      time, darkness and a tangled copse concealed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell me that for an hour I gazed on the loved one in stupid
      indifference. I can believe it well: the blow was stunning. Not a slave
      ventured to approach me; for even their dull natures respected the
      berewement this terrible calamity had brought on. Gradually Dominique
      placed himself before me, holding my infant in his right arm; for the left
      that clasped it when we broke from the burning pile, had been wounded by a
      random bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you, Dominique?&rdquo; I inquired, in tones of deep despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengeance!&rdquo; exclaimed the negro, in a voice of thunder. &ldquo;Leave to woman&rsquo;s
      hands the duties owing to the dead, and let us together hunt down the
      murderers. Vengeance! vengeance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of my faithful follower changed at once the current of my
      thoughts. I raised myself, looked proudly round, and called for food and
      wine. I ate bread&mdash;&lsquo;twas a form; I drank wine&mdash;that was reality.
      I seized my rifle, dagger, pistols; Dominique armed the hardiest of my
      slaves; and, before the sun rose, we set out to visit blood for blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was absent for three days and nights. I started warmly on the
      death-chase, and never was one more keenly followed up. I seemed
      insensible to fatigue&mdash;heat, hunger, thirst were disregarded. Of
      five-and-twenty vigorous axe-men, accustomed from infancy to forest-life,
      by the second evening eighteen were worn out, and unable to proceed; and
      yet I and Dominique&mdash;and he with a wounded arm&mdash;pursued the
      traces of the murderers with unabated ardour. I ate not, slept not, but
      drank brandy and shed blood. Seven of the eight had already perished; but
      that eighth one lived; and without that ruffian&rsquo;s life, my vengeance was
      incomplete. On we went once more, and the human hunt continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the wretch, at last, stretched beneath a tree&mdash;worn down,
      impassive, unresisting. I drew a pistol from my belt&mdash;looked at the
      doomed one for a moment. Three had fallen, resisting, by my hand: as many
      more by Dominique&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, as I replaced the weapon; &ldquo;desire the slaves to string that
      felon up; thou and I, my friend, cannot stoop to be his executioners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned&mdash;witnessed the obsequies of my wife. That scene was too
      much for one already excited by maddening influences; my senses wandered&mdash;and
      memory deserts me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along, long gloomy epoch follows&mdash;ten years; long, long years! Mine
      was a melancholy state of being; for they neither could call me mad, nor
      yet pronounce me sane. My child was placed in a neighbouring convent: she
      grew&mdash;was happy; and became, as the nuns averred, the favourite <i>pensionnaire</i>
      of a dozen. I saw her seldom; for when I did, the striking likeness
      between her and her angel-mother for days unsettled reason. Meanwhile,
      worldly events went prosperously; and, Heaven knows, without the slightest
      wish to increase possessions already more than enough to defray every
      desire and want, still wealth flowed in upon me; and, in the list of rich
      Chilian proprietors, my name stood high.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one period of the year when my reason was invariably disturbed;
      the anniversary of Camilla&rsquo;s murder. The whole of the events attendant on
      that frightful tragedy came back to memory; and the scene was vivid to the
      imagination as if it were really being again enacted. All was before my
      eyes&mdash;darkness and fire; slaughter; the death chase; the funeral; and
      then insanity closed the fearful drama. The domestics were always prepared
      for this awful season; and Dominique remained with me like my shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that a week before this sad anniversary, an English botanist
      passed a country-house, where I was for the time residing, and, stopping
      with me as a guest, he observed the gloom and depression of my manner.
      Having delicately inquired the cause, and made himself master of all the
      circumstances connected with the appalling visitation which I expected in
      another week, he asked permission to remain. This was granted,&mdash;and,
      directing his attention to the peculiar symptoms of my disease, he at once
      pronounced it curable. This bold assertion startled my household, who, for
      ten years, had witnessed the annual return of my insanity, and always
      accompanied, as it was, with unabated violence. But he seemed confident;
      and I felt a secret assurance that, through the instrumentality of this
      man&rsquo;s skill, Heaven&rsquo;s mercy was about to be extended to me, and that blest
      gift, reason, would be eventually restored. I placed myself, and all upon
      my establishment, during the approaching period of my mental aberration,
      under the absolute direction of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not deceived; and the result proved that I had calculated soundly on
      the ability and experience of my unknown visitor. Dreading that it might
      increase my excitement, the Chilleno doctors had inhibited the visits of
      my child. The Englishman adopted a different course: Isidora was sent for
      from the convent, and she ministered to a mind diseased and the soft
      influence of filial love, like the melody of David&rsquo;s harp, effected a
      gentle cure, and soothed into tranquillity a spirit for so many years
      perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the stranger&rsquo;s advice, I determined to quit the country, and return to
      my native land. I disposed of my estates, transmitted my fortune safely to
      England; and, with a dearer treasure far, my gentle Isidora, sailed for
      the island-home of freedom, and landed on my native shores, after having
      been a wanderer and alien for one-and-twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long absence had rendered European manners strange; and, for a time, I
      felt myself unequal to the novel task which a return to England had
      imposed, that of mingling in society. For two years, Isidora and I
      wandered through every portion of the British islands, for the Continent
      was then closed against the traveller. Time, change of scene, and the
      constant presence of my darling child, effected a mental cure, and
      verified the assurances given me in South America by my able physician,
      that my recovery would be permanent. I wished at least to have the
      semblance of a home, although the very name recalled my past calamities;
      and, in order that I might fall back, when wearied with the world, on a
      retirement congenial to my fancy, I purchased that wild retreat in which
      our first acquaintance was so singularly formed. Thither, I have
      occasionally retired to enjoy solitude and my child&rsquo;s society. Ours,
      indeed, seemed stolen visits on the world,&mdash;and we both felt that
      calm pleasure only to be estimated by those who hwe lived for each other
      and alone, when, like wild birds to their nest, we sought and found the
      peaceful seclusion which our mountain home afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your visit, Hector, rekindled feelings long suppressed, and spurred me to
      exertions that, probably, under other circumstances, I should hwe wanted
      nerve to undertake. Strange as it may appear, for several years I watched
      your progress into manhood. The first impressions when we met were
      favourable; and a more extended acquaintance has corroborated them. For
      your sake, and for Isidora&rsquo;s, I have sacrificed my own yearnings after
      solitude, and come upon the stage of life anew. My existence is unknown;
      my errand unsuspected. Should I succeed in my present objects, a noble
      inheritance shall be restored to the rightful heir; and should I fail, I
      have a consolation left, in feeling that I have fortune&rsquo;s gifts at my
      disposal, and amply sufficient, so far as wealth can confer peace and
      independence, to ensure both to my children. You mark the term&mdash;Can
      he to whom Isidora&rsquo;s happiness is to be confided be aught but a son to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The record of an eventful life was ended; and I bound those documents
      together, the perusal of which had occasioned an intense but painful
      interest. It was long past midnight. At day-light it was necessary that I
      should be stirring; and I retired to bed, to snatch a few hours of repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still asleep when a gentle touch upon the shoulder dispelled my
      uneasy slumbers, and the faithful follower of my uncle&rsquo;s fortunes told me
      it was time to dress, and that the camarados of my intended voyage and
      campaigns were afoot, and waiting in the court-yard. Indeed, the
      ratcatcher&rsquo;s presence was intimated already&mdash;for in perfect
      indifference as to what might be the complexion of our future fortune,
      Shemus Rhua was croning an Irish ditty. I dressed by candlelight,
      descended to the eating-room, and there found &ldquo;mine honoured uncle.&rdquo; Alas&mdash;Isidora
      was not there to say farewell. She slept, poor girl, little dreaming that
      we had already parted; and that many a month and stormy passage in a
      soldier&rsquo;s life must wear away, before I should be permitted to return and
      claim her plighted hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector,&rdquo; said my uncle, with a sigh, as he received the papers he had
      entrusted to me, and immediately committed them to the fire, &ldquo;you are now
      in full possession of every secret of my life. &lsquo;Tis done&mdash;the
      disclosure is made&mdash;and I have nothing either to communicate or
      conceal. No more of this; the clock chimes,&mdash;and our hour of parting
      hurries on. I am going to deprive you of a follower, provided you can
      dispense with the services of Captain Macgreal, and that he is willing to
      transfer his allegiance to me. Pray step down; and if the ratcatcher has
      no particular objection, let me have his valuable assistance till you
      return. &lsquo;Strange fortunes produce strange bedfellows,&rsquo; a proverb says; and
      singular positions require as singular agents. Odd as it may appear, in
      the tangled web I shall have to unravel, I may be beholden for success to
      that wild woman who seems devoted to your interests, or this wandering
      personage, who appeal&rsquo;s equally attached, and willing to follow where you
      lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A brief communication with Shemus Rhua effected my uncle&rsquo;s wish; and the
      ratcatcher placed his services at the disposal of Mr. Hartley. Sooth to
      say, the captain&rsquo;s previous experience of a martial life had left no
      craving in his breast after &ldquo;the bubble reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more picturesque than the departure of the fleet from
      Portsmouth; and years afterwards, memory recalled the poet&rsquo;s description,
      and I could have imagined that Byron had been a fellow-passenger. The
      morning was brilliant. The signal gun was answered. All were immediately
      under way.

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I confess the truth? Never did an Irish cadet start for a scene of
      glory with less enthusiasm. In the retirement of my father&rsquo;s house, every
      newspaper that arrived had brought with it fresh details of British
      victory,&mdash;and I longed, like another Norval, &ldquo;to follow to the field&rdquo;
       any honest gentleman who would hwe taken the trouble to show me the
      shortest way of getting a quietus&mdash;miscalled, the road to glory. A
      few months had, however, wrought a marvellous alteration; and but for the
      shame of the thing, I verily believe, I should hwe exchanged with some
      Captain Bailey of the day, and, without requiring &ldquo;the difference,&rdquo;
       forsworn the trade of arms, excepting the bloodless duty appertaining to
      country quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I was regularly committed. The dullest spirit would catch a noble
      impulse. The fields of Roliça, Busaco, and Salamanca rose in glorious
      recollection; another feeling succeeded the regret attendant on a first
      separation from the object of a first love; and, before the second sun
      went down, I should hwe scorned an ignoble return, until &ldquo;with war&rsquo;s red
      honours on my crest,&rdquo; I could hwe proudly claimed my affianced one.
      Speedily the true mercurial temperament of the Green island returned. I
      joined the reckless merriment of all around: we drank, and laughed, and
      sang. Nothing could be more prosperous than the voyage.

    <p class="indent15">

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had scarcely
      landed when I received the unwelcome intelligence that General &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      to whose staff I had been appointed, had been wounded on the retreat from
      Burgos, and in consequence obliged to resign his command, and return to
      England invalided. I felt the disappointment severely&mdash;but as the
      corps that I had previously exchanged into was at Valencia, with the
      Anglo-Sicilian army there collected, much as I should have desired &ldquo;to
      follow to the field&rdquo; the victor of Salamanca, I determined to join my
      regiment without delay, and &ldquo;flesh my maiden sword&rdquo; the ensuing campaign,
      under the colours of the old and honourable Twenty-seventh. Ignorant of
      the route by which I could cross the country to the eastern coast of
      Spain, and anxious to see that gallant army under whose conquering banners
      I had anticipated a glorious opening to my career in arms, after a three
      days&rsquo; sojourn in Lisbon, I left that city of filth and splendour in
      company with half a dozen officers <i>en route</i> to join their
      respective battalions&mdash;some, in return from leave&mdash;and others,
      like myself, to smell powder for the first time. A captain of an Irish
      regiment was of the party. He was a gay, honest-hearted, blundering
      countryman; and from the graphic sketches D&rsquo;Arcy gwe me on the road of all
      attached to the battalion I was about to join, from the junior Ensign of
      sixteen, to the old stiff-backed Colonel of sixty, I became so familiar
      with the corps, that I almost fancied at first sight I could have placed
      my hand on every head, and identified the individual&mdash;and, on the
      evening when we entered the encampment of the regiment, I felt perfectly
      at home, and entered the rude mess-room as much at ease, as if, after a
      temporary absence, I was merely returning to join some old acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a memorable epoch in the military history of Britain, when, early
      in the second week of February, 1813, I found myself in the cantonments of
      the fourth division on the banks of the Agueda. Like all sublunary
      affairs, war has its season of repose; and those mighty masses of armed
      men, who but a few months before had stood in threatening array in
      presence of each other, were separated by mutual consent to recover their
      losses and fatigues, and prepare for renewed exertions. Each had selected
      that portion of the country best adapted for obtaining supplies and
      reinforcements. The allied infantry were cantoned generally on the Agueda
      and Douro&mdash;with their cavalry in the valley of the Moudego, and round
      Moncorbo. One Spanish corps passed the winter in Gallicia, a second in
      Estremadura, and a third garrisoned Ciudad Rodrigo. Of the French armies,
      the head quarters of the northern was at Valladolid; the southern at
      Toledo; and those of the centre, including King Joseph and his guards,
      were established at Segovia. In military circumstances, the rival armies
      found themselves, at the end of the preceding autumn, in a position
      similar to that of men who have fought a battle in which neither have come
      off conqueror. Both had sustained enormous losses without countervailing
      advantages; and each required its casualties to be replaced, and its
      discipline restored. At the opening of the campaign, fortune went as
      heavily against the enemy, as it did against the allies at the close. From
      the 18th of July, when the French passed the Douro, until they recrossed
      it on the 30th, their loss might have been set down at fifteen thousand
      men, and the allies at about a third of that number. While, from the time
      when Lord Wellington broke ground before Burgos, until he halted on the
      banks of the Huebra, in retreat, chiefly from drunkenness and military
      irregularity, eight thousand of the allies were rendered <i>hors de combat</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder therefore that to both armies, winter presented a seasonable
      period of repose, and that both willingly accepted it. Nearly one third of
      his army were in hospital, and hence Lord Wellington deemed that rest for
      it was indispensable. Nor could his opponents avail themselves of this
      weakness, and continue active operations, for the French supplies were
      insecure, and their bases of operation disturbed by Partida bands, which
      were every where swarming on their flanks and in their rear. Indeed each
      army dreaded that the other would resume hostilities; and when a report
      prevailed that Soult, who was upon the Upper Tonnes, meditated an invasion
      of Portugal by the valley of the Tagus, and Wellington had, accordingly,
      removed the boat bridges at Almarez and Arzobispo, the French, equally
      afraid that the allies might cross the river, destroyed all means of
      passage at other points which the English general had overlooked as
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the military position of the allies in the field&mdash;one that,
      abroad, rendered the question of ulterior success an uncertainty; while at
      home, the failure before Burgos renewed loud expressions of discontent,
      which the brilliant opening of the late campaign had partially subdued.
      England was divided into two great sections; one party advocating the
      necessity of continuing the Spanish war, and another decrying it as a
      ruinous experiment. What Salamanca had effected in establishing the policy
      of maintaining the struggle on the Peninsula, the retreat to the Agueda
      had undone; and the balance of public opinion respecting the expediency of
      abandoning the contest in Spain was restored. &ldquo;The ministerial party had
      expected far too much, and consequently their disappointment was
      proportionate: the opposition had raised the wolf-cry until the country
      had ceased to dread it; and they caught desperately at what proved a last
      pretext, to reiterate their denunciations, and abuse him who conducted,
      and those who planned the war. Ministers were denounced for continuing the
      contest, and for starving it&mdash;Lord Wellington both for inactivity and
      for rashness&mdash;for doing too little and too much&rdquo; *&mdash;for wasting
      time at Madrid, and for attempting a siege with means so inadequate, that
      nothing but an enormous expenditure of blood could possibly obtain
      success.

    <p>
      But to the clamour of party and the calumny of faction, he, since happily
      surnamed &ldquo;The Iron Duke,&rdquo; turned an indifferent ear; and the same proud
      feeling that on the heights of Guinaldo had sustained him, when a less
      assured courage might have faltered, enabled him now to regard the malice
      of political opponents with contempt; and, perfectly undisturbed, to
      direct the energies of a master-mind to the completion of those great
      means by which alone a great end could be accomplished. Profiting by past
      experience, the internal economy of the army underwent a sweeping
      reformation. Abuses were sought for, detected, and removed&mdash;every
      hospital was cleared of men who feigned illness to evade duty&mdash;and
      from every depot idlers were driven back to the columns they had
      abandoned. Supplies came liberally from England, proving the illimitable
      resources of the island-home of freedom; and the great captain of the age
      was thus enabled to organize the most splendid force that ever took the
      field&mdash;one, so perfect in every arm, as to warrant its constructor,
      years afterwards, when the greater number of those gallant spirits who had
      composed it were sleeping in the grave, to make the proud and proven boast&mdash;that
      &ldquo;with that army which had crossed the Pyrenees, he could do any thing and
      go any where.&rdquo; No wonder that brilliant era of his life is still readied
      in cherished remembrance by the old Peninsular; and as, deed after deed,
      he details the conquering career of that matchless host, with which he
      crossed the Agueda to halt only on the banks of the Garonne, he may raise
      his head with military pride, and exclaim, &ldquo;Pars fui!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of two hundred thousand men under the direct command of Lord Wellington,
      the Anglo-Portuguese, amounting nearly to seventy-five thousand bayonets
      and sabres, were the flower. From the first moment of the Peninsular
      contest, the British infantry had established its superiority; and now the
      cwalry and artillery were superb. Every thing required for field service
      had been skilfully provided. A fine pontoon train accompanied the army,
      and ambulances were provided for the accommodation of the sick and
      wounded. Other means to increase his comforts were also afforded to the
      soldier; and, for the first time, tents were supplied for shelter in the
      field, while the cumbrous camp-kettle was replaced with others of smaller
      size, and lighter material, as better adapted for all the purposes of
      campaigning.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the suspension of active operations on both sides, and while the
      French and Allied armies were quiet in their respective cantonments, that
      restless enemy, the Partida bands, were busily employed. Longa, in the
      vicinity of Burgos, was actively engaged in harassing the marauding
      parties of the enemy, interrupting their communications, and surprising
      their detached posts; while Hina, in Arragon and Navarre, carried on a
      desultory warfare with equal success. Another less celebrated but not less
      active leader was &ldquo;the Friar,&rdquo; (El Frayle,) who, with a numerous band
      admirably organized, kept Valencia in confusion. Indeed, the Guerillas had
      now become as formidable in numbers as they had ever been audacious in
      their mode of warfare. No longer confining their operations to the cutting
      off of foraging parties and the interception of convoys, they fell upon
      strong detachments, and almost invariably with success; until at last no
      courier could pass the roads, nor even a battalion of seven hundred men
      move from one garrison to another, without the protection of an escort.
      Such was the military attitude of Spain when I joined the fourth division.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dilapidated farm-house I found my future companions in arms seated at
      a comfortable dinner, although a stranger looking mess room was never
      occupied by gentlemen of the sword. It had been the grand apartment of the
      dwelling of a farm proprietor; the house was generally in ruins, but this
      wing had been judiciously selected for the <i>symposia</i> of the gallant
      Twentieth, inasmuch as the roof was nearly weather-fast. The table was a
      collection of old doors placed upon temporary supporters; and as every
      member of the body politic furnished his own conveniency of sitting at
      &ldquo;the board,&rdquo; the especial method of accommodation depended on the ability
      or fancy of the individual. Some, in superior luxury, had deposited their
      persons on a camp-stool, while others were contented with a block of wood,
      a basket, or a broken arm chest. The table appointments were not unique,
      for every person found his own; and nothing was held in common property
      save the viands and the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a lighter-hearted community than the gallant Twentieth could not have
      been discovered. The hardships of the retreat to the Huebra were still in
      vivid recollection; and now, anticipating similar privations, but attended
      by more glorious results, the present was their only care; and over the
      head of the master of the revels the apposite motto &ldquo;<i>Carpe diem!</i>&rdquo;
       had been inscribed with a burnt cork. Heralded by my loving countryman, I
      was introduced in terms of commendation that brought the colour to my
      cheek. I received, consequently, a warm and soldierly reception; and
      before I retired to a shake-down offered me for the night in the tent of
      the junior major, I called every man by an abbreviated name&mdash;or, at
      least, as many of the batch as a memory, slightly obfuscated, could manage
      to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my sowl!&rdquo; observed a short and snub-nosed captain, with an accent
      redolent of &ldquo;the far west,&rdquo; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s dacent wine; and the divil that brings
      it should be encouraged.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s your health, O&rsquo;Halloran; and in
      return you&rsquo;ll call me Philbin, if you plase;&mdash;and now that the owld
      colonel&rsquo;s gone, may I live to see you senior captain of the regiment, and
      then I know who&rsquo;ll command it,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this delicate and disinterested compliment, I replied in suitable
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what the devil keeps Peter Crotty?&rdquo; inquired a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant of the occasion of his absence, I inquired the causes from my
      quondam friend, and learned that the absent gentleman had gone up to
      head-quarters with certain regimental returns; and that his reappearance
      had been eagerly expected, to ascertain what reliance might be placed in
      the rumoured intelligence that an earlier commencement of field operations
      might be looked for than the season could be supposed to warrant. Peter
      Crotty, however, did not appear; an hour passed&mdash;the said Peter was
      cursed and envied according to the mood of the individual; it being
      universally resolved, that he, Peter, had popped into some hospitable
      cantonary, and got drunk for the honour of the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! what a congregation of lies Peter will have to get rid of in the
      morning,&rdquo; said the captain of grenadiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;he&rsquo;ll deliver himself of the cargo in a shorter
      time&mdash;for that&rsquo;s his cough, for a hundred!&rdquo; responded a light-bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant&rsquo;s ear was correct; for in a few moments the denounced
      absentee modestly presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had our meeting been in Kanischatka, I should have claimed Peter for a
      countryman at first sight. He was a stout, well-timbered fellow, of
      soldierly setting-up, and, as far as appearance went, perfectly content
      with himself, and at peace with all the world. To say that he was drunk,
      would not be true; to assert him sober, might have raised a controverted
      question: but leave it to the most charitable, and they would freely admit
      that Peter Crotty, in Connemara parlance, &ldquo;had been looking at somebody
      drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrrah, astore!&rdquo; observed Mr. Philbin; &ldquo;may the divil be your welcome!
      Here have we been waiting these six hours, expecting a little news&mdash;while
      you, no doubt, have visited every wine-house between our quarters and
      Frenada. By this book!&rdquo; and Captain Philbin raised a horn drinking-vessel
      devoutly to his lips, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to report you in the morning to Sir
      Lowry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never listen to him, Peter,&rdquo; observed the grenadier; &ldquo;you must be thirsty
      after your long ride.&mdash;Put that down your neck first, give us some
      fresh intelligence afterwards, and stick as close to the truth as you can
      conveniently.&rdquo; And he presented to the new-comer a nondescript tin vessel,
      filled to the brim with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Crotty had really been thirsty; for he turned down the cup to the
      very bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah&mdash;what kept ye, Peter?&rdquo; inquired the first speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kept me?&mdash;Why, business, and Lord Wellington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Divil a one of me could get away, good nor bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any thing wrong in the returns?&rdquo; inquired the grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sorra thing; for he gave us the height of applause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the aide-de-camp tell you so?&rdquo; asked a listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What aide-de-camp?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t I tell ye it was himself?&rdquo; observed
      Lieutenant Crotty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Himself? Arrah&mdash;the divil an eye ye laid upon him, unless ye
      happened to see him lighting off his horse,&rdquo; observed Captain Philbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Crotty answered this remark by a look of silent contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in for it,&rdquo; whispered my next neighbour, softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back him for
      a regular rigmarole of lies against any man in the Peninsula. But we must
      humour him.&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Peter, and was his lordship commonly
      civil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasanter-spoken man I never was in company with,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did seem pleased with our morning-state?&mdash;The aide-decamp
      told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; it was his lordship. &lsquo;Crotty,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; whispered my friend the major, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s conclusive.&mdash;All&rsquo;s right
      when Peter uses the present personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! &lsquo;Crotty,&rsquo; says he,&rdquo;&mdash;observed another, &ldquo;But you have had a long
      ride; so before you begin a longer story, take the cobwebs from your
      throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the tin cup was replenished&mdash;once more Peter Crotty refreshed
      himself; and then to a very attentive auditory he commenced the detail of
      a recent interview with the &ldquo;great captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, I only got the returns from the orderly room at twelve;
      and as I had ten miles to ride, off the mule and myself jogged
      immediately. Nothing particular occurred on the road, barrin&rsquo; I met Soames
      and Hamilton, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;n Soames and Hamilton!&rdquo; exclaimed two or three voices
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we had a drop of wine, and on I pushed without delay,&mdash;except
      half an hour with the Eighty-eighth; and we had a sort of a lunch of an
      over-driven bullock, the rump-steak,&mdash;by-the-by, it was cut off the
      fore-part of the shoulder, and as hard as the divil&rsquo;s horn.&mdash;We had a
      throw of rum-and-water afterwards&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>one</i>, read <i>three</i>,&rdquo; observed another of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reached Frenada&mdash;rode up to the door&mdash;gave my mule to
      an orderly&mdash;stept into the ante-room, and handed in the returns&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, as the evening was wet, I suppose they allowed you to sit down,&rdquo;
       said Captain Philbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Crotty turned a wrathful look upon the speaker, and then
      continued his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door was open, and every word that passed within I heard plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arrah! what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The morning-strength of the Twentieth, my lord,&rsquo; replied the
      aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Divil welcome the bearer!&rsquo; says the general. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cruel hard, that
      a man can&rsquo;t have a little pace and quiet, without this eternal
      botheration? Tell the fellow to come to the door; and ask him who he is.&rsquo; 
      &ldquo;Be gogstay! I made bold to answer, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me, Lieutenant Crotty&mdash;plase
      your lordship.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Crotty!&mdash;Crotty!&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;Is it Peter Crotty, of the Twentieth?&rsquo;&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arrah, then,&rsquo; replies the general, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t for a thirty-shillin note
      ye had gone home, without my seeing ye. Peter, step in and be off&rsquo;, and
      shut the doer after ye,&rsquo; says he to the aide-de-camp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not at home, if
      any one inquires this evening. And now, Grotty dear, draw a camp-stool,
      and bring your heels to an anchor.&mdash;Ned, says he, for they called one
      another by their names; &lsquo;hand Mr. Crotty a glass. And now, Peter, raise
      y&rsquo;er elbow a trifle, and fill fair. Is there any news astir:&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;unless your lordship has it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Had ye anything to ate on the road?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;We could get ye a broiled
      bone in half a jiffy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too much trouble,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;my lord; I took a bit with the Eighty-eighth,
      as I was coming along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! bad luck to the same lads, Sir Thomas Picton,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; an ould man of me, the thieves! The divil himself&mdash;Christ
      pardon us! wouldn&rsquo;t keep them tolerably reg&rsquo;lar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Christ pardon us!&rsquo; Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did,&rdquo; returned the narrator. &ldquo;Do you think that he stopped to pick and
      choose his words in the company of friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on Peter.&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this time, Sir Thomas, and General Paekenham, never said a word; but,
      like a priest after confessions, they lathered away at the drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you hear lately from y&rsquo;er family:&rsquo; says his lordship to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arrah! the devil a scrape I had from Ireland these nine months,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I see what y&rsquo;er lookin&rsquo; at,&rsquo; says he, as he caught me throwin&rsquo; a sheep&rsquo;s
      eye over at a card-table in the corner&mdash;&lsquo;are you for a rubber, Peter,
      to help us to put in the evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Feaks! my lord,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be afeard, as I&rsquo;m rather out of practice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Make it five an&rsquo; ten,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;y&rsquo;er the divil at that, no doubt, as
      the boy said his mother was at the praying. Come, Ned,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;down
      with y&rsquo;er dust, and we&rsquo;ll cut for who&rsquo;ll have Peter Grotty; and by my
      soul, up comes a red knave. &lsquo;By the powers of pewter, Peter, ye&rsquo;er my
      own!&rsquo; says my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, then, y&rsquo;er welcome to him, if he was better,&rsquo; says Sir Thomas. And
      he seemed cross at losing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;my Lord desired Ned Packenham to make us a tumbler each&mdash;and
      down we sit;&mdash;myself as stiff as a new-made quartermaster, although,
      if God&rsquo;s truth was told, I hadn&rsquo;t a skurrick in my pocket to mark the game
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rsquo; says his lordship, finishin&rsquo; his tumbler at a pull. I
      forgot to mention, that Sir Thomas stuck to the sherry, and Ned Packenham
      helped himself to a sketch of brandy in the bottom of a glass, and took it
      nate, without water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I cuts a black deuce, so the dale was mine; and up turns the ace of
      hearts afterwards. His lordship winked his left eye when he saw it. &lsquo;Be
      the powers,&rsquo; says his lordship, &lsquo;your mother must have been in&rsquo; the
      yeomen, or she&rsquo;d never have had such a son! Many a Sunday ye play&rsquo;d cards
      upon a tombstone instead of goin&rsquo; to mass; God forgive ye for the same,
      Peter!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Burn wants Lieutenant Crotty immediately,&rdquo; said a mess waiter
      from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, holy Mary!&mdash;I forgot to report myself!&mdash;and, may be, I
      won&rsquo;t catch it from the ould lad?&rdquo; exclaimed the partner of Lord
      Wellington, as he sprang from the barrel he was seated on, and hounded
      after the messenger in desperate alarm, while a roar of laughter
      accompanied his hurried exit. A <i>dock an durris</i>, for we were all
      Scotch and Irish intermixed, passed from hand to hand, for the departure
      of Lieutenant Crotty appeared to be the signal for a general dispersion;
      and I accompanied the hospitable friend who had offered me a sleeping
      corner in his tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the cantonments became quiet, and light after light
      disappeared. Within musket range, five thousand men were sleeping, and yet
      not a sound was heard but the measured step of &ldquo;the relief&rdquo; as it went its
      rounds, or the loud challenge of the sentry, answered by a whispered
      countersign. To me, this seemed the opening of a new epoch in my life. I
      now felt myself a soldier. The camp was to be my future home; and,
      stretched around me, lay the victors of many a field, with whom, side by
      side, I was to view, for the first time, the flash of &ldquo;red artillery.&rdquo; My
      couch was fern, my pillow a bullock trunk; and, wrapped in my cloak, I
      sought the balmy visit of the drowsy god, but sought it vainly. A feverish
      excitement had banished sleep, and I could not but envy the profoundness
      of my companion&rsquo;s repose, whose heavy breathing, a minute after the brief
      petition of &ldquo;God bless us!&rdquo; had passed his lips, told how sound were his
      slumbers. I dosed at last&mdash;dreamed of siege and battle-field, while
      gentler thoughts floated at times among these martial visions, and love
      and war were singularly blended. Day dawned, a bugle sounded, the drums
      beat the <i>réveillée</i>, and instantly the camp, hitherto so silent, was
      all life and bustle, like an alarmed bee-hive, as the startled soldiery
      issued from tent and hovel. In a few minutes each regiment formed on its
      respective parade; and the fourth division was reported under arms, as a
      horseman, attended by an orderly dragoon, galloped along the front of the
      cantonment. On reaching the flank of the line, he reined up his horse and
      rode slowly past, directing an eagle glance at every regiment that
      composed the division. The drums rolled, arms were presented, and I had no
      difficulty in recognising in the plainly-dressed stranger, one who had
      already divided the attention of the world with the great Napoleon&mdash;the
      victor of Assaye&mdash;the hero of Salamanca&mdash;Lord Wellington!

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>aving brought two
      or three letters of introduction to some veteran soldiers who served with
      my father in the Low Countries, the delivery of each ensured me a
      hospitable welcome at their respective cantonments. A month had nearly
      been consumed in rambling visits, when it was officially intimated, that
      as the armies were preparing for active operations, the presence of every
      officer would be expected at the head-quarters of his regiment. With deep
      regret I made all arrangements for a journey to Valençia; and having
      procured mules and a guide to secure the transport of the persons and
      property of my fosterbrother and myself, I set out at dawn of day, on the
      7th of March, to pass through Toledo and Cuenca, and reach the
      head-quarters of the Anglo-Sicilian army, to which my regiment was
      attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route lay between the French outposts on one side, and a hilly country
      on the other, infested by Partida bands; and, sooth to say, it would have
      been difficult to decide on which hand lay the greater danger. From the
      French scouting-parties it would be desirable to preserve a respectful
      distance; and for Guerilla civility, we should be mainly indebted to the
      protection afforded by a British uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the head-quarters of the south were established at Toledo, the enemy&rsquo;s
      posts were extended over the country in front of that city, to keep open
      the communications, and enable their foragers to bring in any supplies
      they could obtain. Hence, these roads were rendered dangerous by the
      constant visits of French pickets and marauders; and, by the advice of our
      friend the muleteer, we leaned towards the mountains on our right, after
      we had crossed the Ibor by an unguarded ford below the Hospital del
      Obispo.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that we cleared the cantonments of the allies, our route
      assumed a dangerous character that gave it an additional interest. It ran
      through a debatable land, subject alike to flying visits from the allied
      cavalry, French scouting parties, and guerillas; while, here and there, a
      few disbanded men, of every country and calling, were occasionally
      encountered, who stopped the wayfarer, be he Trojan or Tyrian, with a
      lofty-minded impartiality worthy of the school and spirit of Jack
      Sheppard, easing him of life and purse together, without any impertinent
      inquiry of, &ldquo;Under which king, Bezonian?&rdquo; In plain English, from robbers
      of high and low degree, the routes connecting Estremadura with Valencia
      were rendered almost impassable; and it was nearly a toss-up to the
      traveller, whether the person who called &ldquo;Stand and deliver,&rdquo; was brigand,
      forager, or partida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the roads were hewy and the rivers swollen, yet, as the weather was
      remarkably fine, for a few days the fosterer and I roughed it pretty
      comfortably. It was a new passage in the life of both&mdash;and full of
      youthful vigour, and eager for adventure, we got on gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth evening we reached a little hamlet pleasantly situated on the
      river Sedana. Here, the muleteer had several acquaintances, and the owner
      of the posada was his cousin. Our journey that day had been unusually
      long; and, therefore, the intelligence that a good supper and snug
      shake-down awaited us on our arrival at Villa Mora, was particularly
      gratifying. As we wound down the mountains, the sun set, the vesper-bell
      was heard, and the village lights sparkled through the haze of evening. We
      urged our mules forward to gain the halting-place, as the sky, for the
      last hour, had presented certain appearances, which the guide apprised us
      were always considered to be forerunners of a tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed through the village street and alighted at the door of the
      posada, where we were hospitably received, and inducted to a large and
      lofty apartment, which answered the double purpose of kitchen and parlour.
      Fuel was added to the fire, and due preparations made for further
      entertainment. As the guide had predicted, the night became wild and wet;
      and, accounting ourselves to be most fortunate travellers in gaining our
      shelter before the storm burst, we took a position on a settle where we
      could enjoy the comfort of a blazing wood-fire; and, what was equally
      agreeable to hungry wayfarers, personally inspect culinary operations
      while supper was in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed&mdash;the table was spread&mdash;and the muleteer, having
      stabled his long-eared charge, entered the kitchen, and seated himself at
      the foot of the board. The host deposited a huge leathern bottle in the
      centre of the table, which, as he avouched, contained wine of exquisite
      vintage, and the meal was about to commence, when a trampling of horses&rsquo; 
      feet was heard without, and the landlord rose hastily, and, with every
      appearance of alarm, peeped suspiciously from the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three travellers,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;by San Marco. The Virgin be praised; I
      feared some of those French robbers had returned once more, and that we
      should be plundered by them for the hundredth time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose and looked out, but it was too dark to discover who the late
      visitors might be. One seemed superior to the others; for he flung the
      bridle of his horse to a companion with an air of authority, and quitting
      the court-yard, entered the kitchen of the posada.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently a gentleman of little ceremony; for he stalked direct to
      the fire&mdash;threw his sombrero carelessly to the attendant&mdash;desired
      the landlord to hang up his cloak to dry&mdash;unbuckled a belt, to which
      a long toledo was suspended&mdash;deposited a carbine and brace of pistols
      on a bench&mdash;and then took a seat at the head of the table, with as
      much indifference as if he had been the host himself.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0316.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When disencumbered of hat and cloak, the very singular air and figure of
      the stranger fastened my attention. His face would have puzzled Lavater&mdash;it
      was one that you could not look upon without a nameless feeling of
      suspicion and alarm, and yet, take each alone, and the features were
      positively handsome. Hair, eyes, moustache and beard, were black as the
      raven&rsquo;s wing; and the complexion, dark as a gypsy&rsquo;s. The face was
      well-proportioned&mdash;the teeth white and regular&mdash;I never looked
      on an eye more lustrous, searching, and intelligent; and the forehead was
      nobly expanded. But the <i>ensemble</i> was the worst. It bespoke a stern
      determination, close akin to ferocity; and betrayed a disposition, stern
      of purpose&mdash;ardent in regard&mdash;immitigable in vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s figure was athletic and commanding&mdash;sufficiently
      substantial for any feat of strength, and yet not too cumbrous in its
      proportions for light and active exercise. His under dress was plain. He
      wore a close green jacket and pantaloons, with tawny boots and a buff
      waist-belt, in which a weapon, like a highland dirk with a buck&rsquo;s-horn
      handle, was secured. Such was the exterior of our new companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I examined the stranger with deep attention, a hurried look, on his
      part, round the table, appeared to satisfy his curiosity touching the
      company to whom he had introduced himself. His assumption of superiority
      was at once apparent; and, with the easiest manner imaginable, he usurped
      a regular dictatorship of the venta. Raising the drinking-vessel that
      stood beside his platter, he signalled the landlord to fill it from the
      goat-skin, and at one strong draught emptied it to the bottom, and
      indulged, afterwards, in observations more remarkable for candour than
      compliment, touching the cellars of the posada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, contemptuously, &ldquo;call ye that thin liquid, true
      Carvallôs? Hast thou no conscience left thee, man? &rsquo;Tis well enough
      wherewithal to wash a supper down; but see, honest friend, that you find
      us something better for the evening. Ha!&mdash;this podrida&rsquo;s passable;
      and these partridges seem tolerably roasted. On with more viands. Two
      friends of mine will presently be here. They have good appetites; have
      ridden twenty leagues, and fasted as many hours. Need I say more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whoever the stranger was, his orders were not disregarded. The maritornes
      of the venta renewed her culinary labours; and the host voluntarily
      departed to see that the horses of the late guests had been properly
      accommodated, and make researches in his wine-stores, afterwards, to try
      whether a flask more congenial to the taste of the dark stranger might not
      be procurable. The latter, towards myself and foster-brother, evinced from
      the first, decided symptoms of civility; and among us three there appeared
      to be a friendly rivalship as to which of us should hold out longest at
      the podrida. Were the hostleries in the Peninsula frequently obnoxious to
      such visitors as we proved, I verily believe that half the innkeepers in
      Spain would have been insolvent in a twelvemonth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, gentlemen,&rdquo; observed the stranger, &ldquo;to judge by the performances
      of each other, we seem all in excellent health. No sauce for supper after
      all, like a twelve hours&rsquo; ride through the mountains. What, ho! Sir
      landlord! Wine&mdash;I say; and none of that valuable vintage you keep for
      muleteers and travelling friars, who pay their scores in aves and credos.
      What news, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said, addressing us, &ldquo;What is the English Lord
      about; and will he soon be on the move again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him that on these points I was in blessed ignorance&mdash;told
      the simple tale of my journey to Valencia, and its causes&mdash;and, in
      return, asked his advice touching which route I should adopt, as the one
      most likely to be free from the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have made that inquiry from a better person,&rdquo; he replied.
      &ldquo;I know the mountain country indifferently well; and if you place yourself
      under my guidance, I shall ensure your safety to Cuenca. Thence, to
      Valencia, I shall be able to obtain a passport that the partidas will
      respect. Ha! I see my companions have scented supper in the stable. Sit
      down, Jose; thou and Velasquez have seen more than a single cork-tree
      since you heard the matin-bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the example of their chief, the strangers deposited their
      mantles and sombreros on a bench. Both were well armed; and each placed
      his weapons immediately contiguous to his seat, like men who dread and
      guard against surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought nothing could have exceeded our late attack upon mine host&rsquo;s
      partridges and podrida. Pshaw!&mdash;as trenchermen, we could not hold a
      candle to the worthy twain, who now went to work as if they had been
      steadfastly resolved to clear out the posada of every edible it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they, too, were forced to cry, &ldquo;enough&rdquo; and we all united in a
      closer circle round the fire, while the wine-flask made a frequent circuit
      of the company. Dark and repulsive as the stranger&rsquo;s countenance might be,
      as &ldquo;sweetest nut has sourest rind,&rdquo; he seemed at heart an excellent
      camarado. Indeed, we were no longer strangers. I spoke unreservedly&mdash;told
      him my objects and intentions&mdash;and, in return, obtained counsel and
      information. It struck me as being remarkable how very intimately the
      stranger seemed acquainted with the cantonments occupied by the allies,
      and the facility with which he named the strength and formation of every
      corps that occupied them. Touching the positions of the French armies, he
      was equally well informed&mdash;and, with the Spanish dispositions,
      perfectly familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho&mdash;ho!&rdquo; he exclaimed, holding the empty flask between him and the
      lamp; &ldquo;the bottle&rsquo;s dry. More wine, there! Come, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      shall play host to-night. I felt it rather an uncertainty this morning,
      whether I should have found the posada tenanted by friends or enemies; but
      the doubt has been agreeably resolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the landlord entered&mdash;placed a flask upon the table&mdash;and,
      having extracted the cork, was preparing to retire, when the dark stranger
      motioned him to sit down; an invitation, which it appeared to me &ldquo;mine
      host&rdquo; would rather have declined than accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill thy horn,&rdquo; said the master of the revels; &ldquo;I would ask a few
      questions. There are none present but those to whom a true Spaniard need
      never be afraid to unbosom himself. In that jacket lie honour and good
      faith.&rdquo; He pointed to my uniform. &ldquo;And for my friends, I will be their
      security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never, in my life, saw a host less flattered with a guest&rsquo;s civility. He
      took a seat&mdash;filled a cup&mdash;drank our good health&mdash;and
      appeared excessively uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, my friend, is, I think, Gonsalvez&mdash;and I would ask some
      questions touching some of your acquaintances in Villa Moro. Speak out;
      and&mdash;&rdquo; the stranger lowered his voice to a deep tone, that made me
      shudder&mdash;&ldquo;what is more to the purpose, speak <i>truth!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord winced&mdash;while my dark-visaged friend, in a careless
      voice, continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had occasional visits from the French cwalry during the winter. There
      was a squadron of the 5th chasseurs à cheval here for a month. Where did
      their commandant reside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He quartered himself at the alcade&rsquo;s,&rdquo; returned the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever visit the postmaster?&rdquo; asked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frequently,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What age is Jose de Toro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty&mdash;or more.&rdquo; returned the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what the age of his wife&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Younger by forty years,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Jose de Toro was a fool to marry as he did. Was Captain Hillaire
      particularly intimate with the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said&mdash;but Lord! in a village they say many things that are not
      true&mdash;they said that the poor postmaster was almost jealous. After a
      little time the scandal wore away; and Jose de Toro and Captain Hillaire
      were the best friends imaginable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Base villain!&rdquo; muttered the dark stranger, between his clenched teeth.
      &ldquo;Well, my friend, if the alcade and postmaster found the society of the
      French so agreeable, how did the Cura feel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never could disguise his hatred; and for some days he was kept in
      close arrest, until the pretty wife of Jose Toro pleaded to the handsome
      captain for her old confessor, and obtained his liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;What is the nearest post that is at
      present occupied by the French cavalry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nearest!&mdash;praise to the Virgin!&mdash;I have heard from a
      traveller is at Areanza&mdash;some half score leagues from Toro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; muttered the stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;Get me a trusty messenger; and
      mind that he be <i>trusty</i>&mdash;or&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo; he looked the rest, the
      landlord perfectly understanding it. Egad! I never saw anything more
      expressive; it was a look that conveyed more than any language could
      express. One of his companions rose, and looked from the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the storm has abated! The moon has risen; and a
      finer night to take a hurried march and surprise a sleeping outpost could
      not be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were otherwise,&rdquo; returned he who seemed the leader. &ldquo;And yet
      ten leagues from a French picket, methinks, is tolerable security. Go,
      Velasquez,&mdash;and see that this packet be sent forward, safely and
      swiftly. For his messenger&rsquo;s fidelity I hold the landlord accountable.
      Tell him that;&mdash;and whisper in his ear, that the guest he entertains
      to-night is &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His voice dropped, but a
      smile of sinister expression told the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a secret pocket the dark stranger drew out a splendid watch. &ldquo;Past
      midnight. Come, gentlemen, one round more, and then for bed: we must all
      be astir by cock-crow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottle for the last time made its circuit. Velasquez returned after
      despatching the packet, accompanied by the host bearing a lamp. He
      conducted us to a long gallery, containing at least sleeping apartments
      for a dozen; but the only occupants that night were the strangers, the
      fosterer, and myself. Where the muleteer bestowed himself I knew not; but
      subsequent events sufficiently explained the reason why we were not
      favoured with his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      No stronger proof of caution and insecurity could be required than the
      care with which each individual arranged his clothes and arms. Every
      weapon was placed in a position to be ready for the owner&rsquo;s hand; while
      the business of the toilet was dispensed with altogether, as we all
      stretched ourselves on our woollen beds without undressing. The Spaniards
      crossed themselves devoutly; the fosterer repeated a short prayer; I cried
      &ldquo;God bless us!&rdquo; and in ten minutes all within the spacious chamber slept
      profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hours must have elapsed, and still my slumbers continued unbroken.
      Suddenly an uneasy dream disturbed me, and I started upright on the
      mattress. The lamp was burning gloomily; and the sleepers round the
      chamber were fast as watchmen. I listened&mdash;noises low and indistinct
      without excited my attention. The sounds were such as men make when they
      attempt to move unheard. I glided out of bed, and peeped cautiously from
      the lattice. By Heaven!&mdash;the court-yard was filled with dismounted
      dragoons, and one glance told me that they were enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Spaniard lay on the bed next to mine, and I laid my hand softly
      on his arm. In a moment his dark eyes were turned suspiciously on mine, as
      I stooped my head and whispered that we were betrayed. He heard the
      intelligence without any apparent emotion, slipped quietly from his couch,
      and looked for a moment on the court-yard. I heard him muttering to
      himself, &ldquo;Ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;forty in all: the odds are
      great, and we, too, cut off from the stables. Ha!&mdash;let me think&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      but one hope&mdash;the gate first&mdash;the river afterwards&mdash;ay,
      there lies the only chance of our deliverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flitting from couch to couch, he awakened his sleeping companions. They
      seemed to be men accustomed to similar visitations, for not an exclamation
      escaped their lips, nor even by a word did they betray the least alarm. A
      finger, pointed towards the casement told its silent tale; and each, as he
      arose, peeped from the window on the moon-lit court-yard, and immediately
      comprehended the extent of his danger. In a minute every man was armed and
      ready for the coming struggle; and we looked to the dark guerilla for
      orders, as soldiers to their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a position like ours, safety consists in daring. No matter how great
      the disparity in numbers, we must not wait to be attacked; but push, at
      the sword&rsquo;s point, for the gate&mdash;reach the river if possible&mdash;spring
      boldly in, and trust to the Sedana for our freedom. One word more&mdash;if
      you can&mdash;escape;&mdash;but if the hour is come, fall sword in hand,
      and let the dying effort be vengeance on the oppressor.&lsquo;Tis time for
      action. Strike bravely, my friends: in every blow lies death or freedom.
      And now for the attempt: in five minutes the Empecinado will be a lifeless
      corpse, or free as the mountain eagle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you that dreaded chief?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed Juan Martin Diez: he whose dreaded by-name has carried terror
      with it to the boldest enemy of Spain; who lived the scourge of the
      oppressor, and will die, inflicting injury while his hand can hold a
      sword, and venting his last breath in curses upon those who would have
      enslaved him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drew up silently behind the entrance of the posada; all the bolts save
      one were quietly withdrawn, and that one the Empecinado held. Presently a
      man approached, struck the door loudly, and in a haughty tone demanded
      instant admission. Never was order more promptly obeyed. The Spaniard
      removed the last fastening&mdash;the door was suddenly flung open; a
      discharge from the carbine of the Empecinado laid the nearest Frenchman
      dead upon the threshold where he stood; while bounding from his
      concealment like a tiger on his hunters, the guerilla chief sprang
      headlong among a group of the chasseurs, cutting down a trooper right and
      left, and shouting in a voice of thunder, &ldquo;<i>Guerra al Cuchillo!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden onslaught from desperate men is always formidable; and the enemy,
      never imagining that those whom they expected to surprise, would resist,
      still less attack, a numerous and well appointed detachment, were quite
      unprepared to oppose this unexpected irruption from the posada. The
      guerillas fought with the recklessness of men who feel that they must
      succeed or perish; while, as circumstances occasionally make heroes, the
      fosterer and I, considering that in a close and furious <i>mêlée</i> there
      is no respect for persons, imitated the example of our worthy confreres,
      and, as I was afterwards informed, made a very promising <i>début</i>. The
      atfair was short and sanguinary. Before the French could recover from the
      surprise, nearly a dozen were killed, wounded, or beaten down; the gate
      was gained, and for escape, the chances were decidedly in our favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as it unfortunately turned out, a part only of the French detachment
      had entered the court-yard of the posada, while an equal number remained
      mounted outside the gate. The sudden uproar from within put the outliers
      on the <i>qui vive</i>, and consequently they were ready to receive us.
      Surprised, but nothing daunted, the Empecinado and his companions fought
      with desperate ferocity; and the French cry of &ldquo;Down with the brigands!&rdquo;
       was fiercely answered by the Spanish slogan, &ldquo;War to the knife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conflict now was hopeless; each of us was engaged with three or four
      chasseurs, some mounted and some on foot. I had seen the commencement of
      the fray, but, as is the frequent fortune of war, I was not fated to
      witness its termination. A blow from the butt of a carbine stretched me
      upon mother earth&mdash;and when my senses returned, I found myself a
      prisoner, and in the same apartment of the Venta, where on the preceding
      night I had supped in perfect comfort and security.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round&mdash;the room was filled with soldiers&mdash;and the only
      faces I could recall to memory, were the dark and sullen countenances of
      the two companions of the Empecinado, who were seated on a bench
      immediately in my front, closely hand-cuffed to each other. Both had
      received divers sword-cuts on the head; and their coal-black hair, matted
      with blood, added to a ferocious expression of the features, afforded a
      perfect picture of a captive brigand. Upon the wounded partidas, looks of
      deadly vengeance were directed by all who surrounded them. Many of the
      chasseurs had been wounded; and in the recent affair, five of their
      companions had fallen; and one, whom they all regarded, the second in
      command, and a young officer of great promise, had been stabbed to the
      heart by the Empecinado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I? Where are my companions?&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaped!&rdquo; returned one of the wounded guerillas, with swage exultation.
      &ldquo;Escaped, my friend; to take ample vengeance for thee and me upon these
      murderers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; dog exclaimed a chasseur, striking the captive a sharp blow
      upon the shoulder with the flat of his sabre-blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never witnessed such a look as the insulted, but impotent guerilla
      directed at the Frenchman. Could rage, and hatred, and revenge, be
      concentrated in a glance, that look expressed them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that this hand were free,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;and that it clutched the
      knife that never failed it yet; and then, robber&mdash;.&rdquo; He left the
      sentence incomplete; but none required further words to convey its
      purport.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noise without, was heard. It was the measured step of marching men and
      in a few minutes the <i>elite</i> companies of the 16th Voltigeurs,
      entered and piled arms in the court-yard. Whatever was the cause of this
      military movement, its scale seemed far too extensive for the mere purpose
      of arresting two or three individuals who had made themselves obnoxious to
      the invaders; and this suspicion was confirmed, when it was announced that
      Colonel La Coste, the chief of General Laval&rsquo;s staff, had arrived in
      person, to direct the <i>promenade militaire</i>, as the Frenchman termed
      this midnight expedition.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE EXECUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Charles</i>. Be not afraid of danger or of death; for over us presides
      a destiny, which cannot be controlled. We all hasten to the fatal day: die
      we must, whether upon a bed of down, the field of battle, or the scaffold;
      one of these must be our lot.&rdquo;&mdash;The Robbers.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few minutes
      elapsed, when a movement among the soldiers near the door attracted my
      attention, and Colonel La Coste, attended by several officers of inferior
      rank, entered the kitchen of the posada. The commander was a soldier of
      the republican school; a hale, stout, man of sixty: one who, like the best
      of the French officers, had risen by merit from the ranks, without family,
      descent, wealth, or education. The honest boast of La Coste was, that he
      had been the architect of his own fortunes, and had raised himself to
      distinction. The colonel was highly esteemed as a soldier; but, if the
      times when his career commenced are remembered, it maybe readily supposed
      that La Coste was loose in his moral principles, cold to human suffering,
      and indifferent, provided the end were gained, as to the means that he
      employed in attaining it. The sternest hearts have generally some softer
      point that unites them to their fellow men, and the rude soldiers was no
      exception. That solitary place in his affections was occupied by the
      orphan of his sister; Henri le Ferre was the sole object of the love and
      ambition of the old republican&mdash;and, dead to others, the young
      lieutenant of chasseurs was dearer to that cold-hearted soldier than all
      the world beside. In the career of life, the most unpitying do not escape
      mortal visitations, which force the heart to feel. Henri had perished in
      the recent affair&mdash;and the misery that he himself had probably
      inflicted upon others, was about to fall on the head of one, whom sympathy
      for human suffering had never turned from a purpose which he conceived
      that duty pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the apartment, he appeared excited and out of temper,
      muttering to himself as he approached the fire, and then, turning short
      round, he drew himself up haughtily between the manacled guerillas and
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, sarcastically, &ldquo;Captain St. Pierre, methinks, to-night you
      have had but indifferent success. Five soldiers lost, the great brigand
      escaped, and these paltry scoundrels, fit only for hanging <i>in terrorem</i>
      at a market-place, the sole fruits of a bloody, and, as it has turned out,
      a bootless expedition! How could this possibly occur?&mdash;a squadron of
      chasseurs, checked, defeated, by some half dozen&mdash;call them not
      soldiers&mdash;but banditti! Ay, Captain St. Pierre, <i>defeated!</i> Has
      not the only captive we aimed at escaped ye? Except as examples to the
      peasantry, these fellows are not worth the snapping of a flint&mdash;or
      value of a halter. Is not this failure&mdash;defeat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel La Coste,&rdquo; returned the captain of chasseurs, &ldquo;much of what you
      say is true. We counted with too great confidence upon surprise, and
      overlooked the danger that lies in desperation. It has, indeed, turned out
      a sorry <i>promenade</i>&mdash;little gained, and much, unfortunately,
      lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did the brigands escape to?&mdash;where did they seek shelter?&mdash;why
      were they not pursued?&rdquo; continued Colonel La Coste, speaking with
      breathless rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Empecinado, with one companion, have fairly got away,&rdquo; replied
      Captain St. Pierre; &ldquo;the other three are in your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other three!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel La Coste, contemptuously&mdash;&ldquo;Bah!&mdash;what
      matters the capture of these small scoundrels, when the greater bandits
      have escaped? have they indeed got off? and how, in the devil&rsquo;s name, did
      they effect it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would half believe, through the especial assistance of the black
      gentleman. To steel and lead they seemed impervious, or they never could
      have been proof against one hundred shots and sword-cuts. By Heaven! their
      escape appears miraculous! They gained the river, plunged into the swollen
      stream, and under a biting fire, while bullet after bullet struck the
      water before and behind, they reached the opposite bank unhurt, scrambled
      up the bank, and were instantly lost in the thick cover of yonder
      cork-wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they not followed, hunted, pursued? Is Henri after them?&rdquo; inquired
      the colonel, with impatience; but the question was unanswered. &ldquo;Speak, St.
      Pierre!&mdash;where is my nephew?&mdash;close on the brigands&rsquo; footsteps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean ye?&rdquo; exclaimed the old republican; &ldquo;Is he hurt, or wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse!&mdash;what, dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; was the suppressed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&mdash;when?&mdash;where? I know the worst;&mdash;go on, St. Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel La Coste, my heart bleeds to tell the story. Henri, your adopted
      son, and our beloved companion, is, indeed, no more! The felon leader, who
      has escaped us for the present, singled your nephew out and stabbed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&mdash;Henri!&mdash;my son, my hope, my pride, fallen&mdash;and
      thus to fall! Die in the court-yard of an obscure posada, and perish
      ingloriously like a peasant in a drunken brawl&mdash;Henri! Henri!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long and melancholy pause succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my nephew?&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; returned Captain St. Pierre, and his voice faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me see thee, Henri, even though it be in death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had been removed into the posada, I was for some time insensible to
      everything that passed, and, unknown to me, the body of the young
      lieutenant had been carried in, deposited on a bench immediately beside
      me, and covered with a military cloak. Some of the chasseurs who stood
      between me and the dead officer, now moved aside, and others brought
      lights, while the covering should be removed, and the veteran &ldquo;look his
      last&rdquo; upon the only being whom he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <i>post mortem</i> experience I was a novice. Of course, like every
      Irish boy who made his <i>entrée</i> on the world five and forty years
      ago, I had seen a criminal hanged, and a gentleman shot occasionally. To
      do him justice, old Doctor Dozey, &ldquo;our very learned and approved good
      master,&rdquo; was an indulgent and considerate divine; and as the school was in
      an assize town, where hanging-matches and affairs of honour came off
      frequently, we were always, on such occasions, favoured with a
      half-holiday, to enable us to have a sly peep at the proceedings. Although
      I had often been &ldquo;in at the death,&rdquo; yet with the exception of Mr. Sloman,
      I had never seen the defunct after this mortal coil had been shuffled off;
      and hence the appearance of the countenance, where death had been violent,
      was new to me. I turned my eyes to the bench where the body of the
      Frenchman lay, and, for many a day afterwards, the dead man&rsquo;s face was
      painfully recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was told that the departed soldier had been considered particularly
      handsome, but looking at his countenance after death, I never could have
      imagined it. Its expression was that of one whose spirit had departed in
      intense agony, and every feature was distorted. I saw his companions
      shudder as they looked upon the corpse; and, after one hurried glance, the
      old colonel turned his eyes away, and signed to a chasseur to replace the
      cloak, which had been removed to permit him to view the body of his
      fwourite nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now</i> for another duty,&rdquo; the old man muttered. &ldquo;Place these
      prisoners before me!&rdquo; and, drawing himself stiffly up with his back to the
      fire, he remained in gloomy meditation, while the guerillas and myself
      were conducted from our benches, and drawn up in front of a judge from
      whom, were the countenance an index of the heart, little mercy could be
      hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to me; &ldquo;you wear an English
      uniform&mdash;stolen from the living, or stripped from the dead?&mdash;say
      which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; I returned, boldly; &ldquo;mine is the dress that my rank entitles me
      to wear&mdash;I am a British officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore the companion of brigands? Why are you the confederate of
      these murderers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not their companion,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I knew not who or what they
      were. By accident I met them here last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew them not, and yet you ate with them, drank with them, fought
      with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shot a French chasseur, and cut down a second, as I am informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; these things I did in order to effect escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, did you not meet these bandits here by previous appointment? Are
      you not a spy&mdash;ha?&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;this posada lay directly in my route, as I was bound for
      Valencia. Chance brought these men and myself together, and I knew nothing
      of their designs, their names, nor their occupations. On this head, my
      guide, the muleteer, will satisfy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this period of the proceedings, Captain St. Pierre whispered something
      in the colonel&rsquo;s ear. It was a corroboration, on his part, that the
      statement I made was true. The colonel nodded, and thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, St. Pierre, confirms your story. I have had the honour of
      meeting your countrymen in the field, and they have taught me to respect
      them. The English are stout and gallant soldiers; and at a soldier&rsquo;s hands
      are entitled to that honourable consideration which the brave give and
      receive from each other. But these brigands with whom you have unhappily
      associated,&mdash;these murdering, dastardly, Spaniards&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;False, by the Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed the younger partida of the two: &ldquo;No
      dastards, robber!&mdash;Look out in yonder court-yard&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see
      there a few mementos of a Spaniard&rsquo;s vengeance; and if you lift yon cloak
      again, you will find, that though he departed somewhat hurriedly, the
      Empecinado did not forget to leave behind a token that will bring him
      occasionally to your remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Empecinado!&rdquo; exclaimed a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Juan Diez!&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell and furies! Mount every man; cross the bridge, Captain St. Pierre;
      surround the cork wood&mdash;they may still be lurking there. I&rsquo;ll give
      you twenty voltigeurs. Carry them <i>en croupe</i>. They will beat the
      coverts that horsemen cannot enter. Bring back, dead or living, the enemy
      of the emperor&mdash;the murderer of Henri Lefevre!&rdquo; The guerillas laughed
      scornfully. &ldquo;The cork-wood!&mdash;Will Juan Diez stay there to listen to
      the nightingales?&rdquo; said the younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order was instantly obeyed; the horses of the chasseurs resaddled,
      and, with a dozen picked sharpshooters to scour such portions of the wood
      as might be impenetrable to the cavalry, Captain St. Pierre rode off to
      recover a reputation he considered tarnished by his recent failure; and,
      dead or living, bring back to his commander that dreaded chief, the
      Empecinado.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for this new expedition consumed nearly half an hour; the
      Spaniards sullenly resumed their seats; I sunk into sombre meditations;
      and in short, everybody, captives and captors, appeared superlatively
      unhappy. It was a relief when the door opened, and Colonel La Coste
      entered the kitchen of the posada, accompanied by a person who bore the
      appearance of a civic magistrate. Once more the Spaniards were placed
      before their judge; and the Alcade, for such the stranger proved, assented
      silently to all the French commandant decreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, nor ask your names&mdash;you are rebels to the king, and
      false to France and your country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie! by the immortal Judge!&rdquo; boldly returned the elder partida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True to Spain, ay, true to the last. Pshaw!&mdash;Abridge this mockery.
      We are doomed&mdash;we know it. Speak the sentence, and let the spirit, as
      it was ever, still be free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all the circumstances of this case already,&rdquo; observed Colonel La
      Coste, addressing himself to the Alcade: &ldquo;these men are traitors. What
      penalty should be exacted for treason and rebellion?&rdquo; The Spaniard looked
      confusedly around, turned his eyes aside, and then, in an under tone that
      scarcely reached the ear, he muttered, &ldquo;Death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low as the voice was in which the opinion was delivered, it fell upon the
      ready ear of the younger of the partidas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and doomed to that dread penalty by a countryman?&mdash;Countryman!&mdash;no,
      no,&mdash;the craven has no country. Live, Julian Lopez, live for a brief
      time; but let me add the terms on which that wretched existence of thine
      shall be continued. From the hand that tenders a petition, dread the
      knife. Reject the food offered thee&mdash;it will be drugged. Touch not
      the wine-cup&mdash;it will be poisoned. Well, though thou escape these, a
      more infamous fate will be reserved for thee: you will perish on a tree;
      none pitying, and all pouring out execrations as you go along. Some
      galley-slwe will affix the felon-halter; and when the carrion is committed
      to mother earth, every true Spaniard as he passes the unholy spot that
      covers it, will strike his boot upon the clay, and mutter &lsquo;Curses on the
      ashes of the traitor!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the commandant. &ldquo;Advance these criminals;&mdash;you guess
      your doom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess?&rdquo; asked the elder partida; &ldquo;no, no&mdash;to guess would infer
      uncertainty. We know it well. Thou and I, Jose, shall die as many better
      patriots have died before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are friends of that dark brigand, whom you call the Empecinado?&rdquo;
       observed the French commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed a proud distinction you confer, in calling us friends of
      that bold enemy to French oppression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You share his confidence?&rdquo; continued the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; returned the elder; &ldquo;ay, and I believe as much as any
      living men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew his errand here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the partidas laughed contemptuously
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You trifle with me, villains! But, by Heaven! I will no longer trifle
      with you. Cammaran,&rdquo; he said to a voltigeur, &ldquo;get your men under arms;
      throw the gates of the court-yard open; admit the villagers, and prepare
      for an instant execution. Let twelve files load; we&rsquo;ll join you in five
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer left the room, and the old soldier thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time presses: are you prepared to die?&rdquo; he said, addressing the
      condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proud glance from the condemned conveyed the guerillas&rsquo; answer to the
      commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you avert your fate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; replied the elder of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore? and by what means?&rdquo; said Colonel La Coste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you briefly,&rdquo; replied the elder: &ldquo;I am no soldier; I was born
      on the banks of the Sedana, and inherited a farm my ancestors had tilled
      for centuries. We lived then in humble opulence. My father died; I
      succeeded to his small possessions, married as suited my lowly rank, and
      was as happy as love and contentment can make an humble man. Twice I
      became a father: need I add that this fond tie bound me still closer to
      the partner of my home and heart? Your armies overran the country; but for
      a time the remoteness of our hamlet protected us. Where was the dwelling,
      however isolated, that at one time or other escaped the fearful visits of
      your marauders? A foraging party entered our hamlet. They took what they
      would, and none resisted; they ate, and drank, and plundered&mdash;none
      offered remonstrance or complaint. I was from home&mdash;and I tell the
      tale as it was told me afterwards. Within that solitary hamlet, there
      lived some of the fairest peasants in Toledo. The morning rose upon them
      in happy innocence&mdash;when it set they were ruined and dishonoured.
      Maid and matron alike were exposed to licentious brutality. My poor Inez
      told me the story of her wrongs, and made me swear eternal vengeanee on
      the villain who had robbed her of her honour. He was the leader of the
      party, and that enabled me to trace him. Where he went, I followed&mdash;ay&mdash;followed
      close as a bloodhound on the trail. Night and day I dogged his steps. When
      he removed, no matter how distant were his quarters, there did I, his evil
      genius, appear. Nine months passed, and still I never could strike a
      certain blow&mdash;but he who waits for vengeanee seldom waits in vain.
      The moment came at last, and in the publie square of Salamanca I stabbed
      him to the heart. Vengeance was satisfied: and did I then return to my
      home? <i>I</i> had no home&mdash;it was a ruin. My farm was wasted; my
      cattle taken away; I found my wife a maniac&mdash;for insult and cruelty
      had deprived her of reason. I sought my children&mdash;they were beggars,
      living on the bounty of the charitable. What could I do but swear
      vengeance anew, and band with those gallant spirits who were in arms
      against the oppressors of their country. Well, you ask me, would I live? I
      answer, <i>yes</i>&mdash;not that life to me is worth the holding; but for
      the sake of that poor maniac and her starving orphans&mdash;still would I
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he told his simple story the recollection of his wrongs supported
      him; but the allusion to the sad calamities which French barbarity had
      entailed upon his wretched family evidently affected him; and I observed
      that the dark eye which lately flashed defiance was moistened with a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spaniard, what wouldst thou give for life?&rdquo; demanded Colonel La Coste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aught that became an honest man,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will name the terms, and then say wilt thou accept them and be free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said the guerilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest the Empeeinado&mdash;thou art in his confidence&mdash;his
      haunts are known to thee;&mdash;couldst thou, if at liberty, find him
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were my foot free upon yonder mountain, I eould within six hours hold
      Juan Diez by the hand,&rdquo; returned the condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough. A thousand Napoleons are on his head. Wilt thou place the enemy
      of France within my power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think&mdash;thy life hangs upon the answer: wilt thou win gold and
      freedom?&rdquo; repeated the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&mdash;the word is spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the younger Spaniard threw the arm that had remained
      unshackled around his comrade&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Velasquez,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I doubted thee, and feared that thy courage might
      fail. Thou hast much to bind thee to life; but is a life of infamy like
      that false traitor&rsquo;s,&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the Alcade,&mdash;&ldquo;is such
      worth holding?&mdash;No. But as thou hast addressed this our executioner,
      so too will I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel La Coste knitted his brows together, and the young guerilla thus
      continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indebted to you; I have escaped the insult offered to my companion,
      for you did not propose life to me at the expense of faith and honour.
      Velasquez has told you a sad history&mdash;now hear mine. I am a soldier&rsquo;s
      orphan&mdash;I have no kindred left; for when my only uncle, the good old
      canon of Seville died, I saw my last relative on earth committed to the
      grave. I was then a student, and, but for circumstances, would have been,
      most probably, a monk. You came, and war, and violence, and insult,
      followed in your footsteps. Day after day I heard the hateful tale of
      French oppression, until my blood became gall, and I burned to take
      vengeance on the invaders. The slow and cautious movements of regular
      warfare were unsuited to a spirit active and ardent as mine; I sought a
      daring leader, and found him in Juan Diez. For three years I have followed
      the Empecinado. Would you know more of me?&mdash;ask who I am? Mine is a
      title seeond only to my leader&rsquo;s&mdash;I am &lsquo;The Student,&rsquo; Jose Martinez!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, as he announced his name. La Coste, the moment that the words
      w&rsquo;ere uttered, signed to a chasseur, whispered some secret order, and
      then, turning to the guerillas, he coldly pronounced their doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time is short,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;have either of you aught to ask for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would wish,&rdquo; replied the elder Spaniard, &ldquo;to spend a few minutes with a
      priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Curé shall be sent for,&rdquo; replied the French commandant; &ldquo;and thou,
      young man&mdash;hast thou no request to make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None from <i>thee!</i>&rdquo; returned the Student, boldly. &ldquo;Here! Landlord,
      fetch me a cup of wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order was obeyed: and holding the untasted horn in his hand, he thus
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the last wine that I shall drink! Tell the Empecinado, also, what
      was the last pledge that passed the lips of José Martinez!&mdash;-&rsquo;Viva
      Espana!&mdash;Mueran los Franceses!&rsquo;&rdquo; * And he emptied the cup to the
      bottom.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Live Spain!&mdash;Death to the French!
</pre>
    <p>
      The Cura obeyed the summons of the French commandant, the manacles were
      removed from the wrists of the captives, and the priest retired to a
      corner of the kitchen, apart from all besides, to shrive the condemned
      offender. Scarcely ten minutes passed, before Velasquez rose from his
      knees, and, with a face that bespoke a perfect resignation to his fate,
      stepped back to the place where his fellow-sufferer, the Student, was
      standing, still holding the empty wine-cup in his hand. The Cura motioned
      Martinez to retire&mdash;he obeyed; the shrift was short, and, in five
      minutes, the Student rejoined his companion in misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the prisoners ready?&rdquo; said Colonel La Coste to the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the partidas returned a steady&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman waved his arm, and, with a voltigeur on either side, the
      condemned guerillas left the kitchen of the posada for the court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed in the crowd&mdash;in fact, I was not regarded as a prisoner. I
      mingled with the chasseurs, and, in the interest which the coming event
      occasioned, I seemed to be forgotten altogether. We entered the fatal
      enclosure&mdash;and although the villagers had been summoned to witness
      the execution, not a dozen of the peasantry were to be seen; and, on their
      affrighted countenances, horror and indignation were apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the court-yard, twenty voltigeurs were drawn up in double
      files, with ordered arms, and commanded by a lieutenant. A dead wall was
      directly opposite, at the distance of twelve paces; and thither the
      Spaniards were conducted by their escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel La Coste took his stand on the right of the firing party, some
      half dozen paces from the subordinate officer that commanded it; and, on
      either side, the chasseurs and peasantry formed a line of lookers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel advanced two steps, as the Cura kissed and blessed the
      sufferers for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou be free?&mdash;you know the terms,&rdquo; he said, addressing the
      elder of the partidas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was calmly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&mdash;your blood be on your own head, and not on mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the second he thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, pause&mdash;death is bitter! thou hast many a day of life and
      happiness before thee, if thou wilt but choose wisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have chosen!&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;And now permit me an indulgence&mdash;a
      few last words. I see the faces of deadly enemies around me, and, on the
      blenched countenances of some dastard Spaniards, who stoop and kiss the
      foot that presses on their necks, I look in vain for sympathy; but the
      very walls around me will find a tongue, and the last message of &lsquo;The
      Student&rsquo; will be correctly carried to his friend, the Empecinado. Tell him
      I died a true and faithful Spaniard. Tell him, that my friend and I were
      slaughtered in cold blood, and that we expect at his hands ample and
      immediate vengeance! Proceed!&mdash;art thou ready, Velasquez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silent inclination of the head was returned by his fellow-sufferer, to
      the Student. Colonel La Coste signalled to the officer, and the firing
      party shouldered arms. A dead silence prevailed, and, at the movement of
      the muskets, my heart beat wildly as a startled girl. Many of the French
      soldiery turned pale, and but a very few looked on the scene of death with
      indifference. The emotions of the peasants were now beyond concealment,
      and tears and prayers were freely given to the sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; inquired the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Spaniard bowed, while the Student boldly exclaimed, &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel La Coste nodded to the lieutenant; at a motion of his sword, the
      firing party came to the present, and the next moment the fatal word was
      given&mdash;a volley answered it&mdash;and Velasquez and his companion
      dropped dead on the pavement of the court-yard. Hastily, a cloth was
      thrown over the bleeding bodies, the court-yard was cleared, the soldiers
      were ordered to rest and refresh themselves, and I returned to the kitchen
      of the posada, at the same time a guest and prisoner; and, in the same
      apartment, and within twelve hours,&mdash;I supped with the departed, and
      breakfasted with their executioners&mdash;Such is the fortune of war!

      CHAPTER XXX. THE RESCUE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A kinsman is part of a man&rsquo;s body, of his heart, but a foster-brother
      is a piece of his heart.</i>&rdquo; Waverley.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hose who have been
      familiarized with warfare, know well, from personal experience, how
      callous it renders the heart to human suffering. To me these scenes were
      new&mdash;and to witness my fellow-men coolly hurried to eternity, without
      even the mockery of a trial, had occasioned a sensation too painful and
      powerful to be overcome. When, therefore, Colonel La Coste and his
      officers sate down to breakfast, I felt mine, indeed, to be a sorry
      appetite. The dead guerillas in the courtyard were still before my eyes,
      and men with whom, in the full pride of youth and health, I had taken my
      evening meal last night, were now &ldquo;stark and stiff;&rdquo; and my morning repast
      was to be shared with their executioners. I could not forget them; they
      rose to my imagination like Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, and completely marred my
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel La Coste, who in his own rough way had played the part of a kindly
      host, guessed the cause of my depression, and endeavoured to remove it. He
      had been three years a prisoner in England, and spoke our language
      tolerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my young friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;courage!&mdash;&lsquo;Tis but the chance of
      war, and thy thraldom may be short. Think not that Frenchmen do not
      respect those to whom they are opposed; and while a stern necessity
      renders example indispensable, they know how to distinguish between the
      brigand and the soldier. Eat, and muster thy philosophy. When but a little
      older than thyself, I underwent a protracted captivity&mdash;Did I sink
      into despair? No, faith! A sous-lieutenant, without friends or money, I
      taxed my wits to make a stand against misfortune&mdash;ay, and I
      succeeded, too. There is in England many a tooth-pick case, the handywork
      of Colonel La Coste, to which tooth-picks and their cases, the said
      colonel has been often indebted for a dinner. Think not, that because I
      inflict just punishment upon brigands, I cannot pay due respect to a
      fellow-soldier in misfortune. Give me your parole&mdash;and, while with
      us, you shall be a captive but in name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but when a hope of deliverance remains, I
      never will, by a solemn promise, rivet the chain that binds me. I know all
      chances of escape are desperate, and, without even having seen an army in
      the field, that I shall be transferred to the hopeless bondage of some
      inland fortress. I will give no parole, and if fortune favour me, I will
      be free, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;I understand you! Well, try your chances, and let me take care
      to mar them. Your parole once given, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, no officer of this
      detachment should have been more at liberty than yourself; but as it is
      refused, you will excuse me in treating you as I should the commonest
      prisoner.&mdash;No matter, we understand each other perfectly. You have
      been candid, and I forewarned. Have I your parole while we continue here&mdash;here,
      in this posada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not attempt escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; even though my good friend, the Empecinado, beat up your quarters, my
      dear colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to breakfast now. Durimel?&rdquo; he said, turning to his aide-de-camp,
      &ldquo;this gentleman is under no restraint; and while we remain in the village,
      the gates are open to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed. &ldquo;I am now upon parole, colonel&mdash;I feel flattered with this
      mark of confidence; and lest I might be run away with by these wild
      partidas, I shall wail myself of the protection of your voltigeurs, and
      confine myself within the enclosure of the posada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel La Coste appeared pleased at the frankness with which I addressed
      him, and nothing could surpass the civility of his officers. Perfectly
      acquainted with the accidental circumstances which introduced me to the
      Empecinado and involved me in the <i>melee</i> of the morning, I was
      complimented on my first essay; and more than one of the gallant
      Frenchmen, expressed a sincere regret that my effort at escape had not
      proved more successful. The colonel washed down his breakfast with a
      hearty stoup, while, with the loquacity of an old soldier, he favoured us
      with military reminiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, that your name is perfectly
      familiar to me? 1 am a soldier of the old school, and commenced my career
      at thirty. My first campaign was in the Low Countries, opposed to your
      present commander-in-chief, the Duke of York; and, at his retreat, I was
      in the advanced guard of the Republican army. On both sides, supplies were
      scanty, and as our discipline was not then particularly strict, men
      wandered here and there to make out a supper, if they could. Though in
      years a man, I was a raw soldier in experience; and one foggy evening I
      straggled from the outposts, and, at last, totally missed my way. The
      accursed dykes of that most beastly country confused me, and the further I
      went, the more I got confounded. I tumbled into two or three of their
      dirty canals, and escaped, half smothered, between mud and water, until,
      after an hour&rsquo;s wandering, I at last found myself within the British
      outposts and regularly at my wit&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A light was burning from a casement; I crept on, evaded the sentry in
      front, and peeped through the window. Within, one man was seated, and the
      epaulets on his shoulder told me that he was a field officer. My case was
      hopeless. In a Dutch fog, within the lines of the enemy, the bridges
      guarded, the boors unfriendly&mdash;how, in the devil&rsquo;s name, had I a
      chance of escape!&mdash;and, adopting a desperate resolution, I determined
      to trust to the generosity of an enemy. I tapped lightly on the casement,
      and the English officer rose, and opened it. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;A
      poor hungry devil that has lost his way!&rsquo; said I. He told me to proceed;
      and I honestly informed him that I had been four-and-twenty hours without
      food, and that, in seeking some. I had got out of my own lines, and into
      sundry canals&mdash;was half drowned, half frozen, and half starved&mdash;and,
      to sum the story up, regularly perplexed, and bedeviled. He laughed&mdash;told
      me to come in&mdash;gave me a draught of genuine Schiedam&mdash;pointed to
      a table, where the remnant of a capital supper was unremoved&mdash;and
      told me to eat heartily; (&lsquo;gad, he had no occasion to repeat the
      invitation;) I did so&mdash;again drank heartily from the long-necked
      bottle, and then modestly inquired whether I was a prisoner, or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Heaven forbid, <i>pauvre diable!</i>&rsquo; he answered with a laugh&mdash;&lsquo;No,
      no&mdash;Wert thou a spy&mdash;three dips in a Dutch canal, with the
      mercury below the freezing point, would be punishment enough. I have
      tonight the outpost duty&mdash;I&rsquo;ll pass you&mdash;and should you
      encounter some wandering Englishman, repay the debt!&rsquo; He then left the
      room; I followed&mdash;he saw me across a bridge where the outlying picket
      lay&mdash;and in an hour, I found myself once more with my regiment. Is it
      not singular that his name was similar to yours?&mdash;and that, three
      days afterwards, I met him in the streets of Tyle, bayonet to bayonet? The
      headlong charge of the British grenadiers overpowered us; but I heard,
      with unfeigned regret, that my gallant friend and host had been severely
      wounded, and lost an arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my son, when fortune turned against your countrymen, often and
      fervently I prayed, that should more misfortunes overtake Colonel
      O&rsquo;Halloran, some good chance might place him in the hands of his grateful
      enemy, Corporal La Coste.&mdash;have you ever heard of such a person&mdash;a
      man of my own time of life, ay&mdash;old enough to be your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the latter observation, my dear Colonel, you are perfectly correct, as
      the gentleman in question stands precisely in that relation to me. Well&mdash;it
      is strange enough, that you were indebted for a supper to the parent, and
      repaid it with a breakfast to the son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the old republican folded me in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;son of a brave and generous enemy! May your career,
      my child, be as gallant but more fortunate than your father&rsquo;s; and may you
      return to your native land with a well-won reputation, to cheer the winter
      of the old man&rsquo;s age&mdash;I once hoped the same from thee, Henri!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked for a moment to the corner of the chamber where the dead
      chasseur was laid&mdash;a tear trickled down his cheek&mdash;he brushed it
      hastily away&mdash;then rose and crossed over to the casement, to conceal
      emotions of a softer nature, which, in his stern estimate of a soldier&rsquo;s
      character, he considered unworthy of its dignity. In a few minutes he
      recovered his composure, and was ready to receive the report of Captain
      St. Pierre&mdash;who had just returned to the village, after an
      unsuccessful effort to discover the retreat of the dreaded guerilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the chasseurs announced the failure of the expedition in
      terms that showed how deeply its want of success had mortified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We scoured the woods,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we searched every hovel for a league
      around us; questioned every peasant that we met, and used threats and
      promises in vain: and we are back, Colonel La Coste&mdash;the men worn
      out, the horses wearied&mdash;and we could neither find a trace, nor glean
      the slightest intelligence of the murdering brigand, who, for this time,
      has unfortunately eluded detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rest was absolutely necessary before the cavalry could resume their march;
      and, as a mountain-pass crowned the Toledo road at a league&rsquo;s distance
      from the village, and rendered the route particularly dangerous, it was
      determined that the party should remain at the posada for the night, and
      march at sun-rise. The dead chasseurs were honourably committed to the
      grave&mdash;the soldiers ordered to refresh themselves&mdash;the day
      passed over&mdash;night came&mdash;and, after every precaution had been
      taken to secure the party against surprise, I found myself once more in
      undisputed possession of the hard mattress on which I had rested the
      preceding night. War, like misfortune, introduces people to strange
      bed-fellows, and I never saw that adage so strikingly confirmed. Colonel
      La Coste slept on the Empecinado&rsquo;s bed. Where were the wild and Swarthy
      partisans whom I had seen stretched on those couches now occupied by
      gaily-dressed chasseurs? Cold and lifeless in the court-yard;&mdash;all
      suffering at an end&mdash;life&rsquo;s fever over!
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn of day the trumpet sounded; and as I had never undressed, I
      quitted the crowded gallery to enjoy the morning air. I found the
      court-yard in strange confusion, and the spot where the dead guerillas
      lay, encircled by a number of the soldiery. I stepped forward; the men
      made way for me; and one of them pointed out a paper affixed to the
      Student&rsquo;s breast. It was a placard, couched in Spanish, the words being, &ldquo;<i>Meuran
      los Franceses!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the occurrence was reported to Colonel La Coste, nothing could exceed
      his rage at the insult, excepting his astonishment at the audacity of
      venturing on an attempt, that if discovered, involved the certain death of
      him who tried this dangerous experiment. All connected with the posada
      were subjected to a rigorous examination; but nothing was elicited that
      could attach suspicion to any particular individual. I knew not wherefore,
      but the occurrence raised some hopes of a speedy deliverance; and I felt a
      strong conviction that our march on Toledo would not be effected without
      interruption; and the event proved that my conclusions were correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      We marched at six o&rsquo;clock; and what a scene of melancholy loneliness the
      deserted posada must have presented after our departure! The crowd of
      glittering soldiers gone&mdash;the only occupants, the affrighted inmates,
      and the dead guerillas. We rode slowly through the hamlet; I, mounted on a
      horse that two days before had carried an enemy&rsquo;s chasseur. It might have
      been fancy&mdash;I thought the faces of the villagers had a sinister
      expression as they looked after the French soldiers, while in more than
      one hurried glance, I saw sympathy evinced for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we cleared the village, Colonel La Coste rode up, and signalled that
      two chasseurs, who rode on either side of me with unslung carbines, should
      fall back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your parole is ended&mdash;are you willing to
      renew it? If so, ride in any part of the column you think fit, and
      consider yourself at perfect freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;to do so would be to abandon my last hope of
      liberty. Treat me as a close prisoner; I will not give the pledge you ask
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any secret understanding with the enemy? have you received any
      private information? What hope of escape can you have? The escort is
      strong&mdash;our soldiers vigilant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still&mdash;hopeless as they may be, 1 will not throw chances away. I
      tell you honestly, Colonel La Coste, that I will use every means of
      effecting an escape&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I shall take precautions to render impracticable,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I
      have a stern duty to perform; and even though it cost mine ancient friend
      a son, La Coste shall not be wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waived his hand&mdash;the chasseurs resumed a place at either side&mdash;and
      one took my bridle in his hand. The commandant addressed them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should this gentleman endeavour to get away, or should an attempt be made
      to rescue him that seems likely to succeed, shoot him on the spot. We lost
      one that we should have captured; we must not lose another. Look first, to
      this gentleman&rsquo;s security; and secondly, to his comfort. Impose no
      unnecessary restraint&mdash;but deliver him safely at Toledo, or, mark the
      consequences!&mdash;your lives shall be the forfeit of his liberty,&rdquo; he
      said&mdash;spurred his horse forward, and took his place at the head of
      the column, which had now left Casa Mora in its rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of march ran through a country, wild, picturesque, and difficult.
      A sierra of steep ascent was immediately in our front&mdash;the summit
      crowned with broken crags&mdash;and the sides clothed thickly with ilex,
      cork, and olive trees. As we advanced, the woods grew thicker, and the
      road was surmounted by rocks on either hand. It seemed as if it had been
      originally a great water-course, which human labour had converted into a
      passage through the mountain. We approached the gorge of the pass with
      military caution. Videttes preceded the advanced guard; and, on either
      side, voltigeurs were thrown out in extended order, to feel the woods, and
      keep the flanks secure. Colonel La Coste, after making every disposition
      against surprise, joined the centre of the column, where I was riding with
      my friends the chasseurs, who had been so particularly entrusted with the
      pleasant duty of dispatching me on the first alarm. The Colonel ordered
      them to fall back once more; and, satisfied that we were secure from any
      molestation, he indulged again in fresh details of some of the many scenes
      and services which he had passed through during his adventurous career.
      Still, evidently he was not at ease; and as we entered the defile, he
      could not repress feelings of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an infernal guerilla-pass it is!&rdquo; he half spoke, half-muttered to
      himself: &ldquo;The country and the men seem formed for each other, and designed
      for cut-throat warfare. And the manner the road winds, too,&mdash;you
      cannot see fifty yards in front for rocks and thickets. We&rsquo;re near the
      summit. Heaven be praised!&mdash;for, sooth to say, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, this
      is not exactly the place where I should wish to have the honour of trying
      conclusions with your esteemed friend, the Empecinado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The road made here a wide and sudden sweep, dipping into a hollow in the
      mountain-ridge. Right in front, a pinnacle of rock appeared to bar all
      farther passage, and the path was scarped from its side. The hollow way on
      either side was bordered by thick underwood&mdash;and nothing eould be
      more suspicious-looking than this wild and difficult gorge. Again Colonel
      La Coste rode forward to the front, to restore the order of the column,
      which had become crowded and disordered, from the narrowness and
      ruggedness of the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, however, the commandant could reach his advanced guard, a vidette
      galloped hastily back, and announced that the road in front was entirely
      blocked up with trees, formed into a strong abatis, impassable to cavalry.
      The chasseurs were halted, and the light infantry ordered forward to
      remove the barrier by which the further-progress of the column had been
      thus arrested. Nearly at the same moment, the rear-guard were suddenly
      fired on from thickets on either side, while a number of partidas rushed
      from their previous concealments, and, in a few minutes, effectually
      closed up the narrow road which the detachment had already passed, by
      throwing trees and rocks across it. That the French party were completely
      surprised, was now but too apparent. The voltigeurs, in attempting to
      force the abatis, had been shot down by dozens; and every knoll, or rock,
      which overlooked the pass, swarmed with guerillas, who commenced a
      murderous fire from their long-barrelled fowling-pieces, and that, too,
      upon the close ranks of an enemy where every bullet told.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old republican had ridden forward to encourage the voltigeurs to force
      the abatis, that the column might fight its way through the gorge in which
      it had been entangled&mdash;but he was shot through the heart, and dropped
      dead from his charger. The suddenness of the attack&mdash;the fall of
      their leader&mdash;the appearance of countless enemies on every side,
      completed the panic, and paralysed exertions which, under ordinary
      circumstances, the enemy would have made. To a stern demand to surrender,
      the voltigeurs replied by throwing down their arms, while the chasseurs
      hastily dismounted, and endeavoured to obtain protection behind their
      horses, from a constant and deadly fusilade. Some had endeavoured to
      escape through the underwood&mdash;and a few succeeded in the attempt&mdash;but
      the greater number were cut down; and presently resistance ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness of the surprise&mdash;and the rapidity with which the
      affair had terminated in the destruction or capture of the French
      detachment, seemed magical.&mdash;No attempt had been made to carry the
      orders of Colonel La Coste into execution, and my danger was confined to
      the ordinary chances of receiving a flying bullet by mistake.&mdash;From
      the moment a shot was heard, my captors lost all heart, and appeared to
      consider their situation desperate: generally mercy was extended&mdash;and
      in a time inconceivably short, the prisoners were secured, and stripped of
      every thing that was deemed worthy of notice by the guerillas.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the neat and uniform appointments of the French soldiers, the eye
      turned in surprise on the strange and motley appearance the guerilla band
      presented. Every individual was dressed and armed after his especial
      fancy. All were differently equipped; and had not sad realities presented
      themselves, the whole might have been imagined a military masquerade. The
      costumes of several countries were united in a single dress. The flaring
      scarlet and light blue jacket of an Estremaduran hussar&mdash;the shaco of
      a French chasseur&mdash;pistols and saddle of English manufacture&mdash;the
      long straight sword of the cuirassier&mdash;the brown Spanish sash, and
      leathern cartouch-box, with an Arragonese or Catalan escopeta, were not
      unfrequent equipments of the same brigand, as the French invariably
      entitled them. *

    <p>
      Although none of the captives escaped plunder, and many were cruelly
      insulted in the operation, it was singular that all the partidas treated
      me with respect, and left me unscathed in person or effects. Presently a
      buzz around me attracted my attention. A man was forcing a passage through
      the crowd, and the guerillas civilly made way for him. He was dressed and
      armed in the same wild and incongruous style which marked the costume of
      these irregular partisans; and he looked as much the brigand as if he had
      served a regular apprenticeship to the profession. Great, therefore, was
      my astonishment when I heard him pronounce my name; but greater still,
      when he seized both my hands in his, and half said, half sobbed&mdash;&ldquo;Hector,
      <i>avourneeine!</i>&mdash;Have I found my foster-brother once more?&rdquo; It
      was, indeed, the lost Mark Antony; and, as far as one could judge by
      appearances, the fosterer had neither received damage in the late affray,
      nor in his morning swim over the Sedana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Mary!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is this yourself, Master Hector? Well, I never
      expected to see you alive; though that black gentleman, with the long
      name, strove all he could to give me comfort. May the Lord reward him for
      the same!&mdash;and upon my soul, for a perfect stranger, he showed the
      greatest affection for us both After we were safe out of fire, and taking
      breath for a minute in the cork-wood, I asked him, fair and easy, what he
      thought had become of ye? &lsquo;&rsquo;Gad,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I think its a toss-up between
      shooting and hanging. The chances are, that your master was finished in
      the affray; but if he escaped that, he is sure to be throttled in the
      morning. Don&rsquo;t be cast down,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if they string up our absent
      friend, I&rsquo;ll hang twelve Frenchmen in his place, and you shall keep the
      reckonin&rsquo;.&rsquo; It was very civil on the gentleman&rsquo;s part, but, &lsquo;faith, I was
      better pleased, an hour afterwards, when a goatherd brought us
      intelligence that you were safe and sound, and the other poor devils dead
      as a door-nail. But here he comes&mdash;a mighty pleasant sort of friend,
      but sorra worse enemy one would meet in a month of Sundays. Indeed, I have
      no reason to complain of him; a better comrade I never travelled with&mdash;I
      have lived like a fighting-cock since we came together; and as my clothes
      were made ribbons of in the skrimmage, here I am rigged out anew from top
      to toe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the partida leader approached, wrung my hand ardently with
      his, and warmly congratulated me on my safe deliverance from French
      bondage, and in having escaped any material injury in our outbreak from
      the posada, and the more recent attack. Confiding the duty of removing the
      prisoners, horses, and plunder to Villa Toro, he requested me to walk with
      him to the head of the pass. As we proceeded along the scene of action&mdash;if
      such an affair might so be termed, where the loss was entirely on one
      side, and no resistance had been offered&mdash;I was struck with the
      strange alteration the appearance of the road had undergone. Ten minutes
      since it had been strewn with dead chasseurs and sharpshooters, dressed in
      their showy uniforms, and fully and effectively equipped. Not a soldier
      could be discovered now; but in their places numerous corpses might be
      seen stripped of every covering, and in a state of nudity, that almost
      rendered identity impossible. One body, however, I distinctly recognised:&mdash;the
      white hair, and stern expression of countenance, even after death, could
      not be mistaken:&mdash;the dead soldier was the old Republican&mdash;Colonel
      La Coste.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> could not pass
      the still bleeding corpse of the old commander without gazing for a moment
      on the body, and expressing my sympathy aloud. The Empecinado directed a
      careless look at the fallen Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;La Coste has fought his last battle; and he who would
      wish that the event were otherwise, would be indeed his enemy. I have one
      weak point of character, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, and occasionally, forget the man
      in the soldier. The Spaniard who struck for freedom had in La Coste a
      ruthless foe. By the orders of him and another, I have lost, as you know,
      two brave companions; and within an hour after &lsquo;the Student&rsquo; breathed his
      last, the dying commands of my friend were carefully conveyed to me.
      Vengeance he demanded&mdash;vengeance I swore should be exacted&mdash;and
      I doomed his murderers accordingly. From my fixed purpose no earthly
      intervention could have saved the devoted commander&mdash;but the chances
      of war have averted an ignominious end. He died a soldier&rsquo;s death&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t regret it;&mdash;and the halter, designed for him, is reserved for
      some less fortunate camarado. No more&mdash;the morning has been a busy
      one. Come, we need refreshment. Follow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way through an opening in the <i>abatis</i> made by the removal
      of a tree, ascended the steep rock behind it, and when we gained the
      summit, we found there a guerilla <i>déjeuné</i> prepared. The scene and
      meal were wild alike. Substantial viands, a leathern bottle of capacious
      size filled with wine of superior excellence, a few rude platters, the
      rock our table, the sky, cloudless and blue, the canopy&mdash;while a
      rivulet, clear as crystal, trickled at our feet through the deep hollow of
      a mountain ravine, whose volume of water varied at seasons from a torrent
      to a thread. Above, the rugged pinnacles of the wild Sierra overhung the
      place we occupied&mdash;while below, the broken road wound through the
      underwood, which by turns revealed or hid it. The lower portion was
      crowded with the guerillas and their prisoners in march to Villa Moro, but
      the upper presented a less pleasing spectacle. It was thickly studded with
      the bodies of the slain&mdash;an hour ago &ldquo;instinct with life,&rdquo; but now
      mutilated, cold, and naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found two chosen friends of Juan Diez waiting to share the morning
      meal. As the dark complexion of the guerilla leader had given the
      Empecinado his by-name, so also, the person or profession of his
      companions had obtained for each a <i>sobriquet</i>. One was a low-sized
      man, of extraordinary muscular proportions, who, from a distortion of his
      left hand, was termed El bianco, or &ldquo;The Maimed.&rdquo; The other retained the
      title of his former calling; and although the missal had long since been
      abandoned for the sword, he still was designated &ldquo;El Cura.&rdquo; Than the
      respective dresses and appearance of these partida chiefs, nothing could
      be more dissimilar. The &ldquo;Maimed One&rdquo; wore the simple costume of an
      Estremduran peasant&mdash;while the rich uniform of a <i>chef-d&rsquo;escadron</i>
      of Joseph&rsquo;s lancers of the guard, was adopted by the churchman, whose tall
      and martial figure seemed never intended for one, whose sphere of action
      should be confined to the drowsy duties of cell and cloister.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the invitation of Juan Diez, we assumed a Roman attitude, and stretched
      ourselves upon the rock; the fosterer modestly falling back, as if he
      considered himself unworthy of breakfasting in such goodly presence. The
      Spaniard noticed his secession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a smile,&mdash;&ldquo;hast thou no appetite
      to-day?&mdash;or after sticking stoutly to a comrade in the fray, wouldst
      thou desert him afterwards at feasting time? &rsquo;Tis not the world&rsquo;s way in
      general&mdash;and men love to see the cork drawn, who hate the sparkle of
      a sabre. Sit thee down,&rdquo; and he pointed to a place beside himself. Then
      turning to his companions, the Empecinado thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, my friends, how narrowly I avoided the trap which French gold
      and Spanish treachery had baited for me. I planned and led a desperate
      effort at escape&mdash;and never was man more gallantly supported. This
      youth and I succeeded. &lsquo;Twas all mere accident. We kept our legs and
      gained the river. My brave friend here,&rdquo; (I coloured at the compliment
      like a peony,) &ldquo;and our murdered brethren, were beaten down and captured.
      It is marvellous how the whistle of a passing bullet accelerates one&rsquo;s
      speed&mdash;and faith, I never fancied I could run so fast. If my camarado
      here proved that in the fray he could use his arms stoutly, in flight
      nothing but a goatherd could keep him company. Fast as I ran, he still ran
      faster&mdash;and we fairly outstripped pursuit, save that of two rascally
      voltigeurs, who had thrown away their musquets, and thus lightened, were
      enabled to keep close at our heels. We neared the river&mdash;ten paces
      more would gain the bank&mdash;and then escape would be pretty certain. I
      turned my head to see what number of the enemy pursued us. A score came
      straggling after at various distances, and, fifty yards ahead of their
      companions, those two accursed sharpshooters led the chase. I wished the
      scoundrels hamstrung; but, thanks to our Lady! the Sedana was at hand.
      Alas! it seemed fated that I should not reach its waters. An infernal
      vine-root crossed the path&mdash;it caught my foot&mdash;down I came; and,
      as I believed, my doom was sealed,&mdash;captivity first, and death
      afterwards. My young companion heard my fall; and checking his course, he
      boldly turned to assist me to escape, or share my fate if taken. With a
      blow he felled the leading voltigeur, and while the other hesitated to
      close with two desperate men, I regained my feet, and in another moment I
      and my brwe preserver were breasting the swollen stream, and jive minutes
      found us in safety on its farther side. Yes, my stout comrade&mdash;but
      for thee, France would have been freed of one of her worst enemies, and
      Spain have lost a faithful son. Juan Diez owes thee a life&mdash;and the
      dearest wish of his heart is, that a time may come when he can repay thy
      gallant service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On their own merits modest men are dumb,&rdquo; and therefore, in the
      Empecinado&rsquo;s narrative of our outbreak from the posada, I omit that
      honourable mention was made of the superior style in which I finished a
      chasseur, and rendered a second member of the same distinguished corps <i>hors
      de combat</i>. But decidedly, Mark Antony was the lion of the morning.
      Before his high deserts, mine sank immeasurably&mdash;and from the
      gentleman with the maimed hand, and his pious <i>confrère</i>. El Cura, we
      both received flattering tokens of friendship and respect. As to me, there
      was not a French throat in the peninsula, were it only to be got at, that
      would not be slit at my solicitation; and had the fosterer made the
      request, the French detachment would have been decimated without a doubt,
      to prove the high place he held in the personal esteem of the Empecinado.
    </p>
    <p>
      We despatched our breakfast, the guerillas prepared to move, called for
      their horses, and provided a couple for Mark Antony and me, which an hour
      before had carried different riders&mdash;namely, poor La Coste and his
      aid-de-camp. As we wound down the mountain-road, leading to Villa Moro,
      the Empecinado pointed out the thickets his followers had occupied, and
      dwelt with evident satisfaction on the plan and execution of his late
      successful surprise. And yet, like an unskilful engineer, the mine he had
      charged for the ruin of another, had nearly caused his own. The alcade and
      postmaster were false to their country, and in the pay of the invaders.
      They knew that a French scouting party had secretly advanced within two
      leagues of Villa Moro, on the night we arrived at the posada&mdash;and
      having gained imperfect information that a guerilla movement was
      contemplated, they suspected that the late visitors at the village inn
      were probably connected with the attempt, and despatched our muleteer, to
      apprise the French commandant that suspicious strangers were in the venta,
      where they could be easily apprehended.&mdash;Acting on this intelligence&mdash;correct
      enough so far as it extended&mdash;La Coste executed a rapid night march,
      which failed in its object, and terminated in disaster and defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we reached the little town, the prisoners, with a numerous escort,
      had crossed the Sedana, directing their march upon the mountains which
      divide Murcia from Toledo. As we rode slowly down the streets, <i>Vivas</i>
      greeted us on every side&mdash;the women being the loudest in their
      acclamations. One circumstance I afterwards had cause to recollect. Nearly
      in the centre of the village, I observed a house of superior appearance,
      having a court yard in front, with a beech-tree of unusual size, whose
      spreading branches extended nearly over the whole area of the enclosure.
      The Empecinado turned a careless glance on the building and the tree.&mdash;&ldquo;That
      beech will answer&rdquo;&mdash;he muttered&mdash;and without another
      observation, rode forward and entered the yard of the posada.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was crowded with dismounted partidas, whose horses were picketed and
      feeding&mdash;and in my life I never saw more savage countenances than
      those which were half hidden and half seen beneath the shadow of their
      dark-plumed sombreros. In a remote corner, some dozen French voltigeurs,
      bound two and two, were drawn up. An ominous silence prevailed&mdash;in
      the pale faces of the prisoners, intense anxiety was marked&mdash;their
      guards only conversed in whispers&mdash;and it appeared that all were in
      expectation of some coming event, which seemed dependent on the arrival of
      the Empecinado.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the living my eye turned to the direction where I had witnessed the
      execution of &ldquo;the Student&rdquo; and his friend.&mdash;The bodies, however, had
      been removed,&mdash;but the spot where they had fallen was readily
      discovered, for here and there, patches of cement had fallen on the
      ground, detached from the wall where the bullets of the firing party had
      struck the brick-work.&mdash;Juan Diez cast a gloomy look from the place
      his friends had met their death to that captive group, whose suspense as
      to their fate the presence of the dreaded chief would presently remove&mdash;and
      without uttering a word, he entered the well-remembered kitchen of the
      posada&mdash;the curate and El Maneo following, and the fosterer and I
      with a few partidas bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that this singular chamber was destined to present alternately
      images of life and death, and in quick succession the venta became the
      house of mourning and of feasting.&mdash;On the same table where I had
      supped with the Empecinado and La Coste, the bodies of the dead guerillas
      were laid out side by side, the village priest kneeling at their feet,
      land offering a mass for their souls&rsquo; repose. Until the religious duty was
      performed, the partida leaders observed a respectful silence&mdash;but
      when the Cura rose up and departed, the Empecinado addressed his
      companions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the dying injunction of our lost comrade, when
      he confided to me the sacred duty of executing vengeance on those who
      murdered him. That hour is come, and ere high noon, blood shall be repaid
      with blood. To those without, their doom shall be speedily communicated;
      and on the same spot, and by the same means by which our brethren
      perished, their slayers shall be slain. So much for retribution on the
      enemy. Another task is to be performed&mdash;greater criminals remain&mdash;and
      justice sternly demands her victims. Diego,&rdquo; he continued, pulling out his
      watch, and turning to one of the partidas, who seemed to follow his
      movements as an orderly, &ldquo;Go out&mdash;apprise the condemned that in
      fifteen minutes they will be in eternity. The time is short&mdash;the
      priest must be the busier. Deliver this watch to Juan de Castro; and when
      this hand stands there&mdash;he knows the rest&mdash;and then conduct the
      other prisoners hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whom the Empecinado had addressed as Diego made no reply, but bowed,
      and left the kitchen. In a few minutes he returned, and we looked
      anxiously to the door to discover who the other criminals might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first who presented himself, from dress and appearance, was evidently
      a hidalgo, or Spanish gentleman. The second bore a lower Stamp, and
      appertained to the middle order of society. The third, to our unbounded
      astonishment, was our quondam fellow-traveller, the muleteer. The arms of
      each prisoner were bound behind his back with a common halter, the end of
      which the partida, who conducted the criminal, held within his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the countenances of the prisoners despair was plainly written; and if
      one ray of hope still remained unextinguished in their bosoms, the
      chilling address of Juan Diez would have quenched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dead silence they were placed in a line, and at the foot of the table,
      where the bodies of &ldquo;the Student&rdquo; and his comrade were extended. Bending
      on the devoted wretches a scowl of indescribable ferocity, the Empecinado
      thus addressed them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spaniards&mdash;but in name&mdash;false to your God, faithless to your
      country!&mdash;have ye aught to say why a felon death should not be
      instantly awarded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hopeless agony which the faces of the criminals thus addressed
      exhibited, shall never fade from my memory. Colourless&mdash;wordless&mdash;their
      white lips moved; but not a syllable was articulated but the single
      supplication, half lost, half heard, of &ldquo;mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; returned their stern judge, &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;&mdash;and he laughed. <i>Oh!
      what a laugh it was!&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy, and from me!</i> Look round gaze upon
      your victims&mdash;and then ask mercy from Juan Diez But softly, we must
      be just. The mockery of a trial was extended to our comrades, and a
      similar act of justice shall be meted out to you. I shall be the accuser,
      and those shall be your judges and he pointed to El Manco and the Curate.
      Yes, justice ye shall have; and I swear, by the decree only of these
      worthy gentlemen, life or death shall be determined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed his hand within his jacket, and then slowly pulling out several
      written documents, selected two or three, and then proceeded with his
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me briefly&mdash;speak truth&mdash;for, remember, the first
      falsehood ensures the transfer of yonder halters from arm to neck. Jose de
      Toro,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the postmaster, &ldquo;knowst thou this
      handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person questioned gave a hurried look at the well remembered
      characters, and, with the sickly hope that, leaning on a straw, still
      clings desperately to life, he at once determined to betray his guilty
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that writing is the alcades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hearest,&rdquo; said the Empecinado, handing the fatal document to the
      Cura. &ldquo;Honest Sancho thou wert bearer of a letter, two nights ago,
      addressed to Captain St. Pierre. Wouldst thou know it, honest Sancho?&rdquo; and
      the word <i>honest</i> hissed sarcastically between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the unfortunate muleteer, life was dear as to the postmaster. He took
      the fatal packet in his hand, looked at it attentively, and then replied,
      that he had indeed received it from Jose de Toro, under a promise of ten
      dollars for its safe delivery, which promise had been faithfully
      fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Ho!&rdquo; exclaimed the Empecinado, &ldquo;said I not truly that thou wert <i>honest?</i>
      &lsquo;Tis marvellous what virtue lies in a yard or two of hemp. There, Cura,
      read that letter also, and then thou and El Manco will know what will be
      due to justice. What proves the alcade&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the writer is a traitor, and in French pay,&rdquo; was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, the worthy postmaster&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is a sworn confederate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, Cura, wouldst thou term the caitiff who advisedly was bearer of
      treacherous intelligence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say that, in effecting the villany of others, he was on a par, in
      guilt, with the traitors who employed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, El Manco, be it thy duty to pronounce sentence on these
      offenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maimed one answered this appeal by directing a concentrated look of
      hatred and vengeance at the convicted. Neither the alcade or De Toro had
      power to speak a word; but the luckless muleteer cried lustily, and in the
      name of every saint, for mercy and forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the partida chief, &ldquo;&lsquo;twere wrong to keep you in suspense, as
      one fate awaits ye. But we will justly apportion it according to your
      respective ranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the muleteer, under fallacious expectations, broke in with a loud
      torrent of future loyalty and everlasting gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, fellow, keep thyself cool awhile,&rdquo; said El Manco, drily. &ldquo;Thou
      know&rsquo;st the proverb, surely&mdash;&lsquo;Hallo not until ye clear the forest;&rsquo; 
      and now listen to your sentences. With due consideration for thy rank,
      alcade, thou shalt ornament a topping branch of your own beech tree. The
      postmaster must needs content himself with a lower bough. And for thee,
      good fellow,&rdquo; and he addressed himself to the trembling muleteer, &ldquo;no
      matter to what limb they attach thy worthless carcase, provided thy feet
      clear the court-yard by a yard or two. Off with them&mdash;let them have
      <i>five</i> minutes; and, by San Jago, that will be longer by <i>four</i>
      than the knaves deserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never, on a shorter trial, were men condemned, nor sentence more savagely
      delivered. To a ruthless judge, appeal or remonstrance would have been
      equally unwailing; and they were removed from the posada to the tree in a
      sort of sullen and stupid unconsciousness. Their shrift was short&mdash;the
      last sad ceremony hurried over&mdash;and, as the fosterer afterwards
      observed, &ldquo;they were hanged before they could find time to bless
      themselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passing scene was one that would dwell long upon the fancy.&mdash;One
      may view the dead with indifference&mdash;the trial&rsquo;s over&mdash;the goal
      is past.&mdash;But who can look upon &ldquo;a thing of life,&rdquo; whose thread of
      existence a few short minutes will sever, without recoiling at the
      thought? So much had these sad reflections occupied my mind, that I forgot
      there were others besides those on whom I had just looked my last, who
      were standing on the confines of eternity. But these musings were
      interrupted. Without, a rolling volley was suddenly delivered. It knelled
      the doom of the luckless voltigeurs&mdash;and by a similar impulse, Mark
      Antony and I sprang from the bench, and rushed forward to the casement
      which looked out upon the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the smoke from the guerilla muskets partially obscured our
      view&mdash;but as it rose upwards, we saw the unhappy sufferers stretched
      in a line before the wall&mdash;dead, or rolling in the agonies of death.
      There was one singular exception;&mdash;an officer appeared to have
      escaped&mdash;for he stood upright and firmly on his feet, with his hand
      across his bosom. In military executions, some loaded muskets are always
      reserved to abridge the sufferings of the condemned, should the volley of
      the firing party fail to end existence. But the partidas were willing
      executioners&mdash;every piece had been discharged&mdash;and though the
      Frenchman boldly called on them to &ldquo;fire!&rdquo;&mdash;the order was not obeyed.

    <p>
      To rescue the gallant victim was my instant determination, and I appealed
      warmly to the Empecinado in his favour. The Spaniard shook his head&mdash;and
      the Cura and El Manco protested against any exercise of mercy. The
      guerillas commenced reloading&mdash;in a few brief moments the deed would
      be effected, and remonstrance of no avail&mdash;but a sudden impulse of
      generous ardour eventually proved successful. The fosterer bounded from
      the casement to the courtyard&mdash;sprang through the crowd, passed along
      the front of the firing party, clasped the condemned soldier in his arms,
      and swore in very excellent Irish, and by every saint he could remember at
      the time, that to reach the Frenchman&rsquo;s body, the bullets must pass first
      through his.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a partida in that wild band who did not personally estimate
      Mark Antony as the saviour of their chief&mdash;but still the fosterer&rsquo;s
      was a dangerous and doubtful experiment. It was interposing between the
      tiger who has tasted blood, and the victim already underneath his paw.
      Dark looks were turned upon the preserved and the preserver&mdash;and
      muttered oaths were heard, like the distant growl which heralds the
      bursting of a thundercloud. The Empecinado, who witnessed the occurrence
      from the casement, however, lulled the coming storm&mdash;and in a voice
      that to be heard was to be obeyed, he commanded the surviving prisoner to
      be conducted to his presence; and next moment Lieutenant Cammaran entered
      the kitchen of the pesada&mdash;on one side guarded by a guerilla&mdash;on
      the other supported by the honest fosterer, who still, for better
      security, encircled the Frenchman with his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scott says that &ldquo;a kinsman is part of a man&rsquo;s body, but a fosterbrother is
      a piece of his heart.&rdquo; The truth of the remark never came so home to me
      before. In infancy, the same bosom had sustained us,&mdash;in childhood,
      our joys and sorrows were the same,&mdash;in youth, Mark Antony had
      followed my fortunes, and in manhood preserved my life. No wonder, that
      for him mine was indeed a brother&rsquo;s love. But I never felt so proud of our
      relationship, as when I saw the fosterer confront the guerilla chiefs,
      with his arm locked firmly round the poor French voltigeur.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> never met a man
      who appeared to have made his mind up to die with more dignity and
      determination than Lieutenant Cammaran. He had already almost undergone
      the bitterness of death; as yet his fate was an uncertainty&mdash;the
      sword continued suspended by a hair&mdash;and still the expression of his
      manly countenance was perfectly undisturbed, and neither lip nor eye-lid
      trembled, he planted his foot firmly on the floor, and, calmly and
      resolved, awaited a doubtful result&mdash;the turn of the die, on which
      life and death depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he had escaped mortal injury seemed the miracle: two balls had passed
      through his chaco, his epaulette was divided by another, the jacket
      perforated by several, and yet not one bullet of a dozen aimed at him had
      even razed the skin! In such a presence, and under such circumstances, to
      remain unmoved, required a powerful exercise of moral courage. Few there
      were, who bore the name of Frenchman, who would have coveted an interview
      with Juan Diez. El Manco, in desperate severity towards the invaders, bore
      even a more terrible reputation than the Empecinado; and although the Cura
      was a learned and pious churchman, as it might have been presumed, still,
      from divers exploits ascribed to him, in which unbounded liberties had
      been taken with life and limb, there was not a follower of the intruder
      who would not have preferred an interview with the archenemy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast been condemned to death,&rdquo; said Juan Diez, addressing the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied the captive, steadily, &ldquo;and the only marvel is that the
      sentence has not been yet completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! But for the thoughtless interference of this rash young man, that
      marvel would have been ended speedily,&rdquo; returned the Empecinado. &ldquo;Hast
      thou aught to ask before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he made a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The experiment shall be tried more successfully,&rdquo; said the Frenchman,
      coolly. &ldquo;Yes; I have an orphan daughter! My poor Pauline!&mdash;thou hast
      no mother to protect thee&mdash;and in an hour thou wilt be fatherless! I
      would send her all I have&mdash;my parting blessing; and, with your
      permission, write a brief letter, which this kind and gallant youth will,
      I have no doubt, endeavour to get safely conveyed to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mona sin diaoul!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer, drawing the back of his
      hand across his eyes, &ldquo;Miss Pauline shall get it, though I walked every
      inch of the road, and committed highway robbery for my expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy request is granted. Diego, bring my portefeuille hither. And make the
      letter short,&rdquo; continued El Manco, coldly; &ldquo;I have some ten leagues to
      ride after thy execution; I&rsquo;ll wait until it&rsquo;s over, for I hate to leave a
      job half done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious God!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;surely this cannot be serious! Pause, Don
      Juan!&mdash;One so miraculously preserved&mdash;the very hand of
      Providence visible in his escape!&mdash;Would you slay him?&mdash;deliberately,
      coldly, slay him? No, no, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t believe it. You are brave!&mdash;the
      brave are not assassins; and this would be an act of butchery! You would
      not sanction it. Did I conceive it possible that you would, by Heaven, the
      worst remembrance of my life would be, to think that you and I had ever
      fought side by side, and hand and heart together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniard coloured; but a sarcastic smile was the only reply he
      vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too warm, Don Juan; like that of your own land, Irish blood is hot.
      Forgive me if I have offended you.&rdquo; A gracious smile from the Empeeinado
      was returned, and conveyed a gracious pardon. &ldquo;Now let me ask a favour:
      make me in gratitude your debtor; I have a claim on you. From the
      surprise, three nights ago, <i>I</i> risked nothing but captivity; by the
      French I should have been honourably respected; and had I determined on
      escape, a fitter time and better opportunity would have been readily found
      to attempt it. With <i>you</i> circumstances were different, nay,
      desperate. With you &lsquo;twas but a choice of deaths&mdash;the sword or halter
      the alternative&mdash;while I had only to remain quiet, and not a hair of
      my head would have suffered injury. Did I fail you then?&mdash;Did my
      foster brother? No; we perilled all, fought by your side, and hewed out a
      path by which you escaped a death more certain, even than that which now
      awaits this unfortunate gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran,&rdquo; said Juan Diez, interrupting me. &ldquo;All you have
      stated is correct; and the only difficulty in the case is to reconcile
      gratitude with duty. I see a course by which matters may be accommodated;
      and, from your interference on his behalf, I will save this Frenchman;
      that is, provided he accedes to terms. There are none here but those he
      may rely on. Listen, prisoner, and pause before you answer me.&rdquo; He took an
      open packet from his breast. &ldquo;These papers, in cypher, were found
      carefully concealed upon the body of your late commander: you were his
      secretary, and know the key; give me the means of reading the contents,
      and thou art free as yonder bird.&rdquo; A pigeon passed the casement at the
      moment. &ldquo;Hast thou not the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; returned the captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak&mdash;disclose it&mdash;liberty is thine; and none shall ever know
      the means by which I obtained a knowledge of the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, may this tongue be palsied!&rdquo; And the captive drew himself proudly
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the court-yard, then!&rdquo; returned the Einpecinado. &ldquo;No more, sir,&rdquo; he
      said, perceiving I was about to urge anew my claims upon him for late
      service, &ldquo;have I your final answer to my proposal?&rdquo; he continued, turning
      to the condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fixed and final!&rdquo; was the firm reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And upon my conscience, as a true Catholic,&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer, &ldquo;a
      dirtier proposal, Mister Empecinado, I never listened to!&mdash;you would
      have the honest lad here turn traitor, after hanging three dacent men of
      the same profession scarcely half an hour ago!&mdash;Arrah, have ye
      neither conscience nor decency, Don Juan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; returned the Spaniard, &ldquo;art thou, too, upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Empecinado&mdash;and God sees I&rsquo;m not quite certain whether I&rsquo;m right
      or wrong in mistering you&mdash;but if it&rsquo;s wrong, why leave it on my
      ignorance. We have been comrades for three days, and from the little I
      know of ye, I would go through fire and water to serve you; more by token,
      the coldest swim I ever had, I took in your company over that river the
      other morning. No matter about that&mdash;the glass of brandy we had from
      that friend of yours in the cork wood set all to rights afterwards. Well,
      as I was saying, ye spoke civilly of me not two hours ago fornent these
      gentlemen&mdash;him with the crooked claw, and his reverence in the
      colonel&rsquo;s jacket. Now all I ask you is a trifle. Honour bright, Don Juan!
      Don&rsquo;t ye mind, after the swim, and over a glass of brandy-nate, you
      offered to hang a dozen Frenchmen as a mark of friendship to me and Master
      Hector there? It&rsquo;s not much I want; only just let one neck alone. Do,
      Empecinado, <i>avourneine</i>! Arrah, do, and take my blessing! Why, man,
      it would be murder, out and out, to harm him. Arrah, just look at the
      state ye have reduced him to!&mdash;you have drove two bullets through his
      cap; and as to his jacket&mdash;and may be the best the crature has in the
      world&mdash;it&rsquo;s cut into so many ribbons, that, upon my conscience, a
      respectable scarecrow would be ashamed to wear it in a wheat-field on a
      Sunday. You know I&rsquo;m the last man that would interfere in matters that
      don&rsquo;t concern me.&mdash;Did I part my lips, good nor bad, when ye sent the
      three gentlemen to the gallows a while ago?&mdash;and if you hanged raff
      of their kind out of the face&mdash;for as well as I could understand they
      were bailiffs or attorneys&mdash;sorra one of me would blame ye if ye
      strung them by the score. But this poor crature&mdash;let him go&mdash;and
      take Mark Antony&rsquo;s blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Warm as was the fosterer&rsquo;s appeal, it did not shake the stern resolution
      of the Empecinado; and a cold movement of his head negatived the
      supplication for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t ye, then, be after letting him off?&rdquo; continued Mark Antony,
      warming into Hibernian eloquence, while his cheek flushed, and his dark
      eyes kindled. &ldquo;Ye spoke a while ago about my doing you a civil turn&mdash;let
      this poor fellow free, and I&rsquo;ll do ye twenty more, if you&rsquo;ll only put me
      in the way. But if ye&rsquo;re baste enough to murder him&mdash;<i>mona bin
      diaoul!</i>&mdash;the next time you&rsquo;re in a skrimmage, and tumble over an
      ould tree, may the divil pick ye up for Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole. That&rsquo;s all I
      have to say&mdash;Tiggum thu?&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Anglice,  &ldquo;Do ye understand?&rdquo;,
</pre>
    <p>
      The speaker paused. Most of the fosterer&rsquo;s address Juan Diez comprehended;
      and such portion of the speech as had been delivered in Irish, being
      expletive, were not very material. To the appeal, however, he turned a
      deaf ear, and directed, that after his letter had been written, the
      prisoner&rsquo;s sentence should be carried into immediate effect. I was about
      to remonstrate, but Mark Antony, having the ear of the Court, thus
      continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this your answer?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ah, then, Empecinado, I have
      done with ye! Ay&mdash;and for all your fine speeches, I&rsquo;m be-ginning to
      think you&rsquo;re no great shakes, after all; and as to your promises, they&rsquo;re
      very like what they call pig-shaving in Connaught&mdash;much noise and
      little wool. Come along, Hector, jewel! we won&rsquo;t remain to see this poor
      gentleman fairly murdered. God forgive the whole of ye! I put the sign of
      the cross betune us.&rdquo; And here the fosterer made a crusial flourish with
      his thumb in the direction of the guerilla chiefs. &ldquo;I can only say, that
      if there are three gentlemen in Spain certain of a warm corner in the next
      world, I&rsquo;m just at present taking a parting peep at them. Good morning to
      ye all. I&rsquo;ll be obliged if you&rsquo;ll send one of your understrappers to put
      us on the right road; and I hope, Mister Diez, that the next dacent lad ye
      tatter out of bed at cock-crow, to drag into a <i>rookarn</i> first, and a
      river afterwards&mdash;why&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll trate him civiller than ye
      did me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are few who are proof against eloquence, natural or acquired; and on
      all it has power alike, whether it be exercised in the fish-market or the
      Four Courts. On some men it may have opposite effects; and the florid
      appeal that carries away the judgment of the one, will only alarm the
      suspicions of another; and thus, the same jury, that on the showing of Mr.
      Charles Phillips, values an abstracted lady at a thousand pounds, after a
      prosy address from Sergeant Roundabout, will estimate a similar loss only
      at a sixpence. Mark Antony had very awkward judges to address; like his
      greater namesake, &ldquo;he was no orator,&rdquo; and possibly it was all the better
      for his client. We have some doubts, had Mr. Joseph Hume denounced the
      international illegality of despatching Lieutenant Cammaran of the 16th
      Voltigeurs, with the arithmetical precision with which, in the House of
      Commons, he would calculate the waste of human breath, that the brass band
      of the Guards inflicts on this distressed country,&mdash;we have doubts,
      up say, whether the Empecinado would have been a convert. Had the
      Liberator of Ireland blessed or banned for an hour by Shrewsbury clock, it
      would have been all the same to El Manco&mdash;and to the remonstrance of
      the Bench of Bishops, aided by a rescript from the Pope, the Cura would
      have irreverently played &ldquo;deaf adder.&rdquo; And yet, with such unmanageable
      authorities to deal with, Mark Antony&rsquo;s eloquence prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Juan Diez, as the fosterer turned his back sullenly round,
      to wait while the condemned soldier conveyed to his orphan a last
      farewell.&mdash;&ldquo;Will nothing but this Frenchman&rsquo;s life acquit the service
      that I owe thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Mark Antony.&mdash;&ldquo;what other favour could ye grant
      me? Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I the free use of my limbs, and ten dollars besides in my
      pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if it must be so&mdash;I will not let thee leave me in thy
      debt. Frenchman&mdash;thou art saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Pauline, thou mayst yet receive from living lips, that blessing
      which a dying hand was tracing!&rdquo; and springing from the bench, the
      voltigeur flung his arms around the fosterer, and pressed him to his
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; said Juan Diez, addressing Mark Antony&mdash;&ldquo;that I had
      many creditors like thee! Well&mdash;no matter&mdash;have I now acquitted
      all claims upon me to the full?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Empecinado,&rdquo; I returned&mdash;&ldquo;I am as yet unpaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my friend.&mdash;What wouldst thou have me do?&rdquo; said the Spaniard,
      graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complete the favour&mdash;and add liberty to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juan Diez paused&mdash;looked at El Maneo and the Cura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I answer? I swore that nothing should avert his doom&mdash;and
      thought nothing could have shaken the resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>know</i> that nothing human should have shaken <i>mine</i>,&rdquo;
       observed El Maneo. &ldquo;Life spared, liberty is a trifle&mdash;grant it, Juan
      Diez, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Cura, &ldquo;will not object.&mdash;Great men have occasional
      weaknesses, and at times, I have found myself rather softer hearted than I
      should be. Empecinado, &rsquo;tis sinful to break an oath,&mdash;but Holy Church
      is merciful.&mdash;Hang me the first half dozen of these robbers who fall
      into your hands, and thou shalt have absolution; the penance&mdash;that
      thou shalt fast from flesh meat the first day when you cannot conveniently
      find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this merciful annunciation of the worthy clerk, Juan Diez laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank thee, Cura,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but when I make my shrift, I will seek
      another confessor. Come, the morning passes, and &lsquo;tis time we were wending
      towards the mountains. Gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the fosterer
      and me, &ldquo;our short companionship is about to terminate. If gallantry could
      attach me to brwe men, and make me regret a separation, I should have
      abundant reason to grieve that I am about to lose ye; but, sooth to say,
      for our wild warfare you are not exactly fitted, and, like my excellent
      camarado, the Cura, you have a little too much softness at the heart. From
      intelligence I have received since we first met, I would advise you to
      abandon your original intention of crossing the mountains to Valencia.
      Suchet&rsquo;s movements are suspicious,&mdash;the roads are unsafe&mdash;crowded
      with ladrones&mdash;all desperate men, who would respect no passports,
      were they guaranteed by every authority in Spain. If you choose to
      persevere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Don Juan,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I will return to the allied cantonments. I
      have, in obedience to orders, endeavoured to reach my regiment. I have
      failed; and, to say truth, I don&rsquo;t regret it. I shall resign my
      commission, if required, and serve under Lord Wellington a volunteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such being your intention, I would recommend that you return by the
      shortest and openest route. Should you touch upon a French outpost, this
      gentleman will protect you,&rdquo; and he pointed to Lieutenant Cammaran; &ldquo;if
      you fall in with the allied cwalry, you will return the compliment; and
      should you tumble upon any friends of ours during the journey, you carry a
      passport that every partida on the peninsula will respect. Ho, Diego!
      bring me yonder writing-case. Fortunately, sir, you do not require it at
      present,&rdquo; and the Empecinado smiled as he addressed the reprieved one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to these noble Englishmen, I do not,&rdquo; returned the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Mr. O&rsquo;Toole; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly tell what
      countryman I am, because I was born at sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine!&rdquo; cried the Empecinado. &ldquo;Ho, landlord! stir thyself. Thou know&rsquo;st my
      taste&mdash;none of that sorry stuff that would poison a Manolo. Let&rsquo;s
      have some fit for Christian men. Remember, honest Gonsalvez, thou hast
      rarely such honourable guests. Here are three foreigners of distinction;
      and there a holy churchman. Of my friend here,&rdquo; and he pointed to El
      Manco, &ldquo;I shall say nothing: and modesty forbids me speaking of myself.
      Come, let thy wine be good, or, by San Juan, we&rsquo;ll quit thy venta
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a low bow, the alarmed innkeeper hurried off. As he passed us, the
      expression of his countenance was ridiculously intelligent; and to the
      last sentence of the Empecinado, said, or seemed to say, &ldquo;I wish to Heaven
      you would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wine that the host produced no doubt was excellent, for its effect
      upon the company was marvellous. Juan Diez jested with the Curate; the
      Frenchman and fosterer conversed in broken English; occasionally El Manco
      vouchsafed a relaxation of the facial muscles, which he intended to
      represent a smile. All seemed happy but the innkeeper; and on his dull
      countenance terror and anxiety were imprinted. On him the lively sallies
      of his distinguished visitors were lost; and the only occurrence at which
      his sombre features lightened was when a guerilla entered the apartment,
      and announced that the horses were saddled in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the party resumed their cloaks and weapons, the Empecinado beckoned
      to me, and I retired with him to a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there aught in which I can oblige you? Speak freely,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and answered him in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is thy pocket lined, my child?&rdquo; was his next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him my purse was liberally supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can spare thee a dozen pistoles,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged the kindness, but declined the offered subsidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked suspiciously around, and then took a packet from his bosom, and
      placed it in my hand, unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceal these papers, and deliver them carefully, with my duty to Lord
      Wellington. They are written in cipher; but I know that he has a key that
      will unravel their contents. I feel assured that they contain important
      information, for I have learned through a channel where I never was
      deceived, that the expedition of La Coste was originally intended for no
      other purpose, than to enable him to communicate with another commandant
      to whom he was directed to transfer these papers safely. A movement of two
      strong detachments to secure the delivery of a letter is a sufficient
      guarantee, my friend, that the contents are momentous. Let us go. El Manco
      is impatient. Outside the village we part&mdash;thou, to the low country;
      I to the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou hearing a confession in yonder corner, Empecinado?&rdquo; inquired the
      monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cura, I would not usurp the functions of the church with one of its
      brightest ornaments immediately beside me. I was merely giving my young
      friend here a slight hint of what Juan Diez has experienced, and I&rsquo;ll once
      more repeat it.&rdquo; Then, turning to me, he added aloud, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an uncertain
      world, and many a brilliant opening in a young life has darkly closed.
      Should fortune frown, friends fall off, enemies prevail&mdash;in short,
      should thy young career be darkened as mine was suddenly, take thy chance
      with Juan Diez; and thou, my friend,&rdquo; and the Spaniard addressed the
      fosterer, &ldquo;thou, too, wilt any time be welcome; and, as we crossed the
      Sedana, we&rsquo;ll swim or sink together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the guerilla pointed to the door. We took the hint, and passed
      on. There the worthy host stood, cap in hand, bowing us out, as it became
      customers of distinction. I would have stopped and demanded a reckoning,
      but Mark Antony was of opinion that such a proceeding might have been an
      offence in the sight of our patrons and protectors. Certainly, I saw no
      bill paid or delivered; and I have reason to believe that the guerilla
      leaders were of the school of ancient Pistol, and consequently gentlemen
      of too good taste to stoop to an inquiry into accounts. And yet proofs of
      disinterested regard were not wanting to Senhor Velasquez. I overheard the
      Empecinado, as he passed, impress on this favoured innkeeper the immediate
      necessity of replenishing his bins with better wine, and restoring his
      stable-loft, which needed repair sorely. In my presence certainly none of
      the circulating medium passed; and, to use fashionable parlance, I verily
      believe the unfortunate proprietor of the posada was regularly victimized
      by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the court-yard; and, thank Heaven, for the last time. A score
      of guerillas, mounted and dismounted, were in waiting. Cammaran passed
      through with averted eyes; but I ventured a look at the well-remembered
      spot which, within eight-and-forty hours, had witnessed a double
      execution. The voltigeurs were lying as they fell; the bodies weltering in
      a pool of blood, or exhibiting, in other cases, no mark of violence
      whatever. One I passed by was a mere lad. His death must have been
      instantaneous&mdash;one fracture in the jacket was opposite the heart&mdash;the
      countenance was tranquil; and a smile played upon the lip. Could that be
      death? I knew it was, or I could have fancied well that he was dreaming of
      absent friends, and calmly indulging in a siesta.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted when we cleared the court-yard. El Manco and the Cura were
      waiting for us&mdash;presently, Juan Diez rode up; and, followed by an
      escort of some score of cavalry, we, for the last time, passed along the
      street of Villa Moro.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had witnessed enough of guerilla life to render it thoroughly
      disgusting. War at best is bad; but &ldquo;war to the knife&rdquo; is only tolerable
      for savages. All the romance of partida daring had passed away. I had seen
      it in its naked light, and found its real character&mdash;a ruthless,
      reckless disregard to every feeling which binds mankind by a common tie&mdash;by
      turns suffering without complaint, and inflicting without compunction.
      Such were my impressions as I slowly rode along the village street; and
      had they needed any confirmation, the scene reserved for me would have
      been quite enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the huge beech tree I had already remarked in front of the house of the
      chief magistrate, three human bodies were suspended. The Empecinado&rsquo;s
      passing observation, and El Manco&rsquo;s sarcastic address while dooming the
      unhappy offenders, came back vividly to my recollection. The sentence had
      indeed been executed to the very letter, and alcade, postmaster, and
      muleteer, were hanging precisely as the &ldquo;maimed one&rdquo; had decreed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst feature of the savage picture remained&mdash;six wretched
      orphans who had witnessed the expiring agonies of their father were still
      screaming from the windows from which they had seen him die, and from
      fear, insensibility, or both, their immediate neighbours dared not, or did
      not, offer the slightest mark of sympathy under a berewement that would
      have touched all but savage hearts. The fosterer turned pale; the
      Frenchman shuddered; the Empecinado regarded the dead men with a marble
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;El Manco,&rdquo; observed the Cura with a smile, &ldquo;Jack Hangman has done thy
      bidding, and the alcade overtops his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; returned the &lsquo;maimed one;&rsquo; &ldquo;this ever be the fate of traitors! Would
      that every oak in Spain bore such acorns as yonder beech tree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sick, nauseated, disgusted. Death&mdash;death in every shape! and
      from the bottom of my heart, I blessed God that my acquaintance with my
      excellent friends was to determine so speedily. Until we cleared the
      village I preserved an unbroken silence; and when Juan Diez pointed to a
      place where our respective roads branched off at the distance of a
      furlong, my bosom felt as if it were lightened of a load, and, as Doctor
      Pangloss says, &ldquo;I breathed again.&rdquo;

      Bring forth the horse!&mdash;the horse was brought;

    <p class="indent20">
      In truth, he was a noble steed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Mazeppa.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few minutes&rsquo; easy
      riding brought us to the spot where the roads diverged, and where it had
      been previously arranged that we should part company. We took leave of El
      Manco and the Cura; the fosterer and Frenchman turning their horses&rsquo; heads
      in the direction of Toledo, while the partidas took the mountain route.
      Consequently, the Empecinado and I were left alone, the escort passing on,
      with the exception of a single horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not wherefore, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, but I feel more reluctance in
      saying the word &lsquo;farewell&rsquo; than is my wont. The chances against our ever
      meeting in this world are enormous. Well, it matters not&mdash;&lsquo;tis but a
      too frequent occurrence in life&rsquo;s history&mdash;the parting from those we
      esteem. Believe me, I shall ever look back on our brief acquaintance with
      pleasure, and wish you the best fortunes that attend a soldier&mdash;death
      or distinction. If I live, you will hear of the Empecinado. The tale may
      not be flattering; it may be of enemies destroyed, of villages laid in
      ashes. Men will speak of him as of a demon, and women cross themselves
      when they hear his name pronounced; and yet, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, I was once
      such another as thyself. Mine, at thy own age, was the same ardent and
      disinterested courage, that at the posada risked life to save a stranger;
      and when the flush of blood had cooled, I would have recoiled, like
      thyself, from treading on a worm. And I was happy. I had a home on the
      sweet banks of the Huebra. I had a wife&mdash;a child. The Madonna&rsquo;s
      features at the altar, where we plighted our bridal vows, were not
      lovelier than Camilla&rsquo;s&mdash;the infant&rsquo;s on the holy Virgin&rsquo;s knees, not
      sweeter than my boy&rsquo;s. I lost both, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran&mdash;lost them&mdash;but
      <i>don&rsquo;t ask how!</i> In one brief day, Juan Diez&rsquo;s nature changed, and he
      became what he is, cold to the misery he inflicts on others, from the
      fearful remembrance of what he underwent himself. But enough; sometimes
      recall the Einpecinado to thy recollection, and think on the inn of Villa
      Moro. Thou shalt have one token to bring me to thy memory&mdash;&lsquo;tis this
      horse. He is a titling gift; black as the rider he carried in safety
      through as great extremity&mdash;ay, even as that we encountered the first
      morning that we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him warmly, but declined to accept the charger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it would appear that in turn Juan Diez is to ask a favour and be
      refused,&rdquo; he remarked, with an appearance of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, Empecinado. I am too grateful for the past to incur fresh
      obligations. Why, look but at the value of the animal! My foster brother,
      as we rode together, was observing, that he doubted whether there was a
      more beautiful charger in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I question if there be; and yet I got him cheap enough. He cost me but a
      three hours&rsquo; ride. To be sure, the night was dark, and the road the worst
      on the frontier. He was the fwourite steed of one of Spain&rsquo;s worst
      enemies; and the pistols, which you will find loaded in the holsters, were
      a gift from Napoleon to his minion. On the borders of Portugal I cut off a
      small detachment, escorting plundered property for better security to
      Ciudad Rodrigo. Of these spoils, Junot was the chief proprietor. I divided
      them among my band, but kept this charger, partly from personal regard for
      the French marshal, and partly as a memento of my success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still I declined the Empecinado&rsquo;s present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us change the terms. If you will not receive, you shall
      purchase; for I am determined to get rid of him. Are you aware that I have
      increased my stud this morning by eighty-three? I think I can spare one.
      Come, will you accept or purchase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled; and jestingly replied that a long price was beyond the means of
      a young subaltern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can afford <i>long</i> credit,&rdquo; said the Empecinado, in the same
      playful mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse still, Don Juan. My father is an old soldier, and in his catalogue
      of military offendings, debt holds a prominent place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pause, my friend, until you hear the terms of sale. To your companion, I
      owe a life. His shall be the horse. Settle the price with him, and to <i>him</i>
      transfer the value. But no more of this. The roads are sometimes puzzling
      to a stranger, and that follower of mine&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the mounted
      guerilla&mdash;&ldquo;will accompany you to the first town where mules and a
      guide are procurable. You may trust him implicitly; in everything he will
      direct you; he is true as steel, and could lead you blindfolded from one
      end of Toledo to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed my hand, sprang into the saddle of the troop-horse I had just
      vacated, and, with a kind adieu, cantered after his companions, who were
      now fully half a mile ahead, and, in a round trot, hurrying towards the
      highlands. A turn in the road speedily concealed him&mdash;and it was the
      last I ever saw of Juan. Diez.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon overtook my fellow-travellers. On what subjects they had previously
      occupied themselves I cannot guess, but my advent caused the fosterer to
      be rather anxious to hurry what seemed an undecided monetary transaction
      to its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the divil a <i>shurrich</i> they would leave ye&mdash;the thieves!&rdquo;
       observed Mark Antony to Lieutenant Cammaran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Shurreeke!</i>&rdquo; repeated the Frenchman,&mdash;&ldquo;what you mean by <i>shurreeke?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a music,&rdquo; said the fosterer, in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music&mdash;music!&rdquo; and Lieutenant Cammaran shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;not the king&rsquo;s picture in your pocket, to keep the divil
      out of it,&rdquo; continued Mark Antony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil in my pocket, and the king to keep him out&mdash;I do not
      understand at all,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the fosterer, in despair, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all useless knocking sense
      into the head of a foreigner. What a loss it is the man does not speak
      Irish, and I&rsquo;d make him comprehend me in a jiffy. I was just mentioning,
      that as these guerillas had cleaned him out, he would be all the better of
      five or six dollars till he got home, poor fellow. But why are ye riding
      the dark gentleman&rsquo;s horse? Lord, what a figure! If I ever get hanged for
      horse-stealing, it will be for borrowing such another. But where&rsquo;s that
      Mister Empecinado, as they call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotting as briskly to the mountains as a thick-winded French troop-horse
      will carry him,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the one you rode?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it;&mdash;we have made an exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An exchange?&rdquo; The fosterer gwe a whistle. &ldquo;So it was jockeying you were?
      Well, God sees I never suspected that Mister Diez was in the line, and
      fancied that he used halters on two-legged animals only. Did you stand a
      knock?&mdash;and what did he allow ye for the old trooper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, let me see if he&rsquo;s all right. You offered him <i>eighty?</i>&mdash;and
      you&rsquo;ll pay the money if anybody leaves you a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty!&mdash;Pshaw! Look again, Mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fosterer made a circuit, and examined that horse which erstwhile had
      not borne &ldquo;the weight of Antony,&rdquo; but the Due d&rsquo;Abrantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, upon my conscience, I&rsquo;m fairly puzzled. He&rsquo;s up to fourteen stone
      with fox-hounds; and, unless he&rsquo;s a deceiver, he has <i>the go</i> in him.
      May be, ye promised a <i>hundred?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred! Why, Mark, I fancied you knew something of a horse&mdash;<i>a
      hundred?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop for a minute. Mister Cammaran, would ye be so civil as to hold the
      bridle?&rdquo; and down got the fosterer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just slip my hands over his
      hocks. Clean as a whistle! What&rsquo;s that, inside the off leg?&mdash;It&rsquo;s a
      lump of clay. Feaks, I thought it looked like a splint at first. Did you
      examine his wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never asked a question about it,&rdquo; I observed, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;r done to a turn. Oh! Mister Empecinado, may the divil&rsquo;s luck
      attend ye! Spakin people fair and asy, and only waiting to walk into them
      afterwards! Did ye even get an engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a line;&mdash;I took the horse on chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feaks! and ye might as well, I fancy; for I suppose if he was a regular
      roarer&rdquo; (here be it understood the horse and not the Empecinado was
      meant), &ldquo;all the attorneys in Connaught couldn&rsquo;t find Mister Diez out, and
      serve him with a latitat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the horse worth, Mark? Never mind latitats and attorneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth? In Balinasloe he would fetch a hundred readily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he took the pound-wall kindly, ye might lay on thirty more. Did
      he gwe you a dacent luck-penny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a farthing,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after all, the Spaniards are shabby divils in horse-dealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Toole,&rdquo; I said gravely,&mdash;&ldquo;without allusions to luck-pennies,
      pound-walls, splints or spavins,&mdash;what is this horse worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark Antony scratched his head, an invariable remedy resorted to by an
      Irishman in a puzzle. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s all right&mdash;feeds well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come&mdash;take all for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mark Antony, &ldquo;hee&rsquo;s value for a hundred and fifty, or he&rsquo;s
      the biggest thief on earth. But I know there&rsquo;s not a wink on Mr. Diez, and
      he laid it on pretty heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, light or heavy, you ingrate, will be yours,&rdquo; and I repeated the
      terms of the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fosterer was confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in faith, Master Hector, they&rsquo;re the quarest people to deal with I
      ever met with. One while ye&rsquo;r drinking with them fair and asy; the next
      jumping into a river to save ye&rsquo;r life. Here, half-a-score of men are
      shot: there, another batch are hanged. The fellow that sleeps beside you
      to-night is dead as a mackarel the next morning. All&mdash;hanging and
      shooting&mdash;and you can nather make head nor tail of what it&rsquo;s all
      about. That <i>critch</i> * they call El Manco strings up the postmaster,
      I suppose, because he mislays a letter; and the Curate throttles the
      mule-driver for no other reason than that he delivered another safely.
      Troth, I&rsquo;m right glad that we have parted company, although grately
      obliged to Mr. Diez for his civility. Indeed, I think he&rsquo;s the best of the
      batch. El Manco has the gallows in his face; and if it wouldn&rsquo;t be sinful
      to spake ill of the clargy, that father what-do-ye-call-him in the
      colonel&rsquo;s coat, is one of the loosest-looking parish-priests I ever came
      across. But, come, let us jog on; the evening appears gloomy, and the Lord
      only knows where we are to put up to-night. If one could get into some
      quiet house for a wonder&mdash;not that I expect to sleep&mdash;for sorra
      thing I&rsquo;ll drame of for a month of Sundays, but gallowses, guerillas, dead
      men, and every kind of divilry besides.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Before Mark Antony had done speaking, the partida rode up, pointed to the
      dark appearance of the sky, and intimated that we had three leagues to
      ride before we should reach our intended quarters. We took the hint
      accordingly&rsquo;, and spurred forward in the hope of reaching our halting
      place before the rain came on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were disappointed. On the verge of the horizon, distant lightning began
      to scintillate like northern-lights; and, hardly audible, now and again
      the growl of a coming storm fell upon the ear. Momentarily the flashes
      became more vivid, the thunder became more distinct, large drops fell, and
      the guide declared that the tempest must burst immediately, and the first
      shelter we could reach would be a happy deliverance. There was a venta
      immediately beside us. It was remote, ill-kept, and bore but an
      indifferent reputation. If we could put up with bad fare and other
      inconveniences, there we would find shelter. If, however, we would risk a
      drenching for more comfort, we must abide the storm, and push on. We held
      a brief consultation. Suddenly the sky appeared to open; a flash of blue
      lightning issued from the riven cloud&mdash;we felt its heat distinctly; a
      peal of thunder, such as I had never heard before, succeeded; and with one
      voice we cried out for the neighbouring venta. The guerilla turned
      instantly sharp off into a narrow and neglected road, diverging on the
      left from the main route. We followed on the spur, and just as the rain
      began to fall we galloped into the yard of an inn, which had been once an
      establishment of considerable extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unpromising as it might appear, that evening it was eagerly desired. A
      furlong off we saw half-a-dozen horsemen spurring down the hill, and
      evidently bound for the same destination. As precedency belongs to the
      first comers, we were determined to secure that best point in law&mdash;possession;
      and while the guerilla and Mark Antony led the horses to the stable, the
      French voltigeur and I entered the house, occupied the best corners of a
      bad kitchen, and made immediate inquiries into the actual state of the
      larder and wine bins. Alas! neither question was replied to
      satisfactorily. All was answered in the past. On Tuesday, there had been a
      side of goat&mdash;three travelling merchants pronounced it excellent; on
      Wednesday, the same trwellers finished a pig&mdash;the best the landlord
      had killed since St. Stephen&rsquo;s; on Thursday, there had been partridges;
      (Friday, being a meagre day, was omitted in the account;) on Saturday,
      pigeons and a podrida. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, every thing was also
      excellent, and so varied that the host could not correctly enumerate the
      delicacies under which the table groaned. But, unluckily, to-day, and by a
      most calamitous fatality, nothing was to be had, good, bad or indifferent!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this miserable report had been concluded, a bustle in the yard
      announced the arrival of the wayfarers whom we had observed pricking down
      the hill; and while we were still listening to some wretched expedients
      which the landlord was proposing as an apology for a supper, two of the
      new comers made their <i>entrée</i>. They approached the fire, after
      having laid their wet riding cloaks aside; and the difference between the
      external appearances of the twain was so very ridiculous, that, by mutual
      impulse, Cammaran and I interchanged a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      One seemed an hildalgo of the Quixotic school&mdash;a thin, tall, shabby
      half-starved looking gentleman. His gait was stiff and lofty; and at
      first, the unhappy man seemed to labour under a delusion that we would
      resign a corner in his favour. Speedily that error of opinion was removed;
      and he ascertained, that upon us the imprint of his dignity was lost. He
      therefore contented himself with taking a place before the fire,
      demanding, in lordly tones, attendance, and more fuel,&mdash;&ldquo;but none did
      come, though he did call for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other was a round, stumpy, well-fed, happy-looking little man, now
      touching close upon the grand climacteric. The world had evidently gone
      well with him, to judge by what, in Ireland, they would term &ldquo;a
      cozey-character&rdquo; of countenance. He poked the fire, but complained not;
      talked of the wild evening, and blessed the saints he was under shelter;
      hoped, rather than expected, that we might obtain a supper; concluding
      with a Christian-like expression of resignation, that really would have
      done honour to a Turk. New appeals were in the interim made to the
      landlord. The hidalgo swaggered; well, as the fancy say, it was &ldquo;no go.&rdquo;
       The voltigeur stormed&mdash;the answer invariably was, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
      ye.&rdquo; The little man was responded to by a shrug; and all we could learn
      from him of the posada was, that the past had been a land of Goshen&mdash;the
      future bade fair to exceed it&mdash;but that the present was a dreary
      blank, which might be beneficially employed for the soul&rsquo;s health in the
      shape of mortification. As for me, I should have objected, in Falstaff&rsquo;s
      vein, to fast &ldquo;upon compulsion,&rdquo; when the door opened, and in came our
      partida escort, the fosterer, and three of the most ferocious-looking
      scoundrels I ever laid an eye upon, &ldquo;armed to the teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how now,&rdquo; exclaimed one of them,&mdash;&ldquo;nothing like supper yet?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in any hurry.&rdquo; said the little man; &ldquo;Senhor!&mdash;there was one
      here, I think last Tuesday, and very excellent&mdash;roast pig, a podrida,
      and some partridges; and should you happen to pass this way within a
      fortnight, you&rsquo;ll come in for a leg of a very promising porker, provided
      they can only catch him in the beech-wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strangers began to storm; the host appeared, reluctantly underwent a
      searching examination; and nothing transpired, but that there had been,
      and would be, entertainment. A most unsatisfactory discussion ensued. The
      hectoring of the ill-looking gentlemen, who had just joined us, had no
      effect; and as they say in England, that there is a certain &ldquo;Duke
      Humphrey,&rdquo; who keeps a most inhospitable table, I began to fancy that he
      had another establishment in the peninsula, and that for our sins, we had
      unluckily stumbled on the house; but, glory to the Empecinado! I was again
      beholden to him for a supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the host aside, the partida commenced a whispering conversation.
      What was the subject none could guess, but momentarily the argument waxed
      warmer. The guerilla gesticulated&mdash;the landlord drew up his shoulders
      to his ears. At last the horseman&rsquo;s countenance assumed a look of ferocity
      that threatened ruin to the venta and all appertaining to the same; and
      plunging his hand into his bosom, he suddenly produced&mdash;not a knife,
      as the host apprehended, to judge from the rapidity of his retreat&mdash;but
      a paper, of small dimensions, whose writing appeared to possess a
      cabalistic influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; cried the partida, furiously. &ldquo;And if thou wouldst not have this
      old building reduced to ashes, and afterwards swing at thy own sign-post
      before eight and forty hours pass, lead these gentlemen to a fitting
      chamber, and prepare their supper incontinently. Dost thou hesitate,
      fellow?&mdash;be it so&mdash;I will faithfully acquaint the Empecinado how
      willingly his orders were obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By every saint in the calendar!&rdquo; exclaimed the unhappy innkeeper, &ldquo;you
      wrong me, sir. A dog sent hither by that most respected gentleman, would
      be more welcome than another man&rsquo;s horse. I fly to obey your orders. Oh!
      that we had but killed the pig this morning! But the will of Heaven be
      done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of Juan Diez&rsquo; name upon the host was scarcely more potent than
      it appeared upon the guests generally. The hidalgo lost a moiety of his
      self-importance, the handy-looking little man became uncomfortable, the
      audacity of the spados vanished, and every look in the company was turned
      deferentially towards me, the Frenchman, and the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this honest innkeeper had not held promise only to the ear, was
      forthwith evidenced. Culinary operations commenced, and the whole venta
      was immediately in an uproar. After despatching a sorry meal of black
      bread and goat&rsquo;s-milk cheese, washed down with a glass or two of <i>aqua
      ardiente</i>, the ill-visaged trwellers pleaded business, and took their
      departure, although the rain fell fast, and the next house of call was
      more than two leagues distant. Presently the host appeared, and, with a
      profound bow, announced that the chamber for our reception was in
      readiness. We rose and left the kitchen, and were conducted into a
      half-ruined sort of hall, to which, however, a tolerable wood fire and
      spread table gave a comfortable air. A leathern bottle was on the table,
      to which we immediately applied; and, with an assurance that all haste
      consistent with superior cookery should be employed in the preparation of
      an excellent supper, the host left us to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad wine, by Saint Anthony!&rdquo; exclaimed Lieutenant Cammaran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had some experience of Juan Diez as an enemy,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;now
      what think you of him as a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of him?&rdquo; said the voltigeur: &ldquo;why, that I would rather travel Spain
      with his letter of introduction in my pocket, than even with an autograph
      of the Emperor&rsquo;s. He is a most estimable gentleman, were it not for that
      infernal fancy he has of using hemp and gunpowder so liberally. No matter:
      as my neck&rsquo;s safe, here&rsquo;s your health, <i>Empecinado</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed the fosterer, &ldquo;did you remark the effect the first whisper
      of his name had upon the thieves who set out upon their travels for the
      evening? They&rsquo;re regular highwaymen, for a hundred,&mdash;up to
      everything, from stripping a priest of his vestment, to stealing a
      pinafore from a child. By the Lord! I thought they would have choaked
      themselves struggling with cheese that would have soled a shoe. But here&rsquo;s
      the old fellow of the inn,&mdash;I hope to tell us something about
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The host announced the welcome tidings that in a few minutes our repast
      should be paraded: and further added, that he was commissioned to inquire
      whether we would permit the two gentlemen who had remained in the kitchen,
      to join our company&mdash;and the host was ready, even upon oath, to
      guarantee their respectability. The lineage of the hidalgo was so ancient,
      that all traces of it were lost; and of the doctor, Fame spake loudly, as
      a personage who could do anything but raise the dead. To this double
      application I returned a gracious reply; and in five minutes a powerful
      odour of garlic and onions was felt in the direction of the kitchen, and
      the innkeeper re-entered with a huge turreen. heralding to our presence
      the descendant of Don Quixote, and his friend the short stout gentleman.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ever was a Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s dinner put on a table with more ceremony, than that with which our
      supper was served up; and yet, the whole entertainment was embodied in one
      tureen. What its contents were, none, save those who designed and
      fabricated the medley, could even pretend to guess at. In an ocean of
      oleaginous liquid, a lean fowl was floating, surrounded by shapeless
      substances, which might possibly be either &ldquo;fish, flesh, or good salt
      herring.&rdquo; It looked grease, and smelt garlic. The host, however, praised
      it excessively, and so would an Esquimaux; but I am morally certain, it
      was the last thing, in the shape of a light supper, that either Paris or
      Abernethy would have recommended to a dyspeptic patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was marvellous how much the lean hidalgo and the little doctor,
      &ldquo;who all but raised the dead,&rdquo; managed to consume, and seemed delighted
      with their fare. To me, it was an unspeakable relief when the abominable
      composition was totally removed; and indeed, for an hour afterwards, the
      apartment was not endurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early, the hidalgo and physician were summoned to their dormitory and
      withdrew; and we agreed generally that it was a prudent step on the
      gentleman&rsquo;s part, the mess he had swallowed considered, to sleep with his
      doctor in the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the general appearance of the establishment, we had no reason to
      expect that the sleeping department would be an exception to the rest, and
      consequently we were in no hurry to make the experiment. Some very
      wretched wine was exchanged for better, on a hint from the guerilla, that
      there was such a person as the Empecinado in existence. The Frenchman was
      exceedingly companionable; the night was wet and stormy; the partida
      heaped on wood, as if the host had been proprietor of a forest; and we
      still sate on, regardless of sundry intimations from the innkeeper, that
      the clock of a neighbouring monastery had &ldquo;gone twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was this your first adventure, gentlemen?&rdquo; inquired the voltigeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our first in Spain,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and certainly, in no smaller portion of
      human life could more unexpected incidents have been crowded, than into
      those which have just occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; returned the Frenchman; &ldquo;the opening of my military career
      was sufficiently eventful, but yours exceeds it far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask where the scene lay?&rdquo; I demanded of the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It commenced,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;under the most brilliant successes which ever
      intoxicated a conqueror&mdash;in Germany&mdash;only to witness the
      greatest reverses which ever overtook insatiable ambition. I served,
      gentlemen, in that accursed country, where the bones of three hundred
      thousand gallant men are blanching&mdash;that grave to the glory of
      France, that boundary to the ambition of Napoleon&mdash;Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you engaged in that luckless expedition?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was. Mine is but a brief history; and as you heard me, under peculiar
      circumstances, make allusions to my orphan child, I will, in a few words,
      tell you her father&rsquo;s story, and briefly detail the adventures of
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE VOLTIGEUR.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like most of the distinguished officers in our service&mdash;but do not,
      gentlemen, suppose for a moment that I include myself in the list&mdash;I
      am humbly born. My mother was the daughter of a vine-dresser&mdash;my
      father, ranger of a forest. You see that I lay no claim to ancestry&mdash;but
      the villagers assert that my parents were the handsomest and fondest
      couple in the commune. Their course of love and life was brief alike. My
      mother died in giving me birth&mdash;and three years afterwards my father
      was shot accidentally by a <i>chasseur</i>, while hunting in the forest of
      which he had the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief felt and expressed by the Seigneur at this unfortunate
      occurrence was deep and lasting. At once he adopted me, and I became an
      inmate of the chateau. There I was brought up and educated; and having
      evinced an early taste for music, that talent was cultivated, and at
      eighteen I played on several instruments, and my singing was particularly
      admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur had an only child, a daughter. He had been early left a
      widower; and naturally of retired habits and sombre disposition, he lived
      in comparative seclusion, dividing his time between two all-engrossing
      objects, the chase and his daughter&rsquo;s education. Pauline was now fourteen,
      and of very opposite temperament to her father&mdash;sprightly, spirited,
      and affectionate&mdash;every action was the effect of impulse. Poor
      Pauline! like many in the world, she acted first, and thought of it
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the father and the child I was equally a favourite. To the forest I
      accompanied the Seigneur, when he hunted: and for Pauline, I dressed her
      flower-garden, sang <i>chanson d&rsquo;amour</i>, and played in the evening on
      the flute. How long, in that remote domain, I might have continued to
      dream life thus away I know not. The great event in my history occurred&mdash;I
      was drawn in the conscription, and the guitar was exchanged for the
      musket.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three years I followed the eagles of the Emperor. Battle after battle
      was won, and kingdom after kingdom submitted, and was partitioned or
      disposed of in whatever way was pleasing to the conqueror. Europe was
      almost at Napoleon&rsquo;s feet; and, save to England alone&mdash;that
      indomitable enemy to his colossal strides towards the subjugation of a
      world&mdash;his voice was law. After the signature of the treaty of
      Tilsit, there came a short and deceitful calm. Many of the soldiery
      obtained leave to revisit that land a Frenchman loves so dearly. I was of
      the number; and one sweet September evening, he who had left the chateau,
      half-huntsman half-troubadour, presented himself to the Seigneur and
      Pauline, a sous-lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a change three years had wrought upon us all! The Seigneur had become
      grey as a badger. I left Pauline a girl&mdash;I found her a woman; and the
      bud of beauty was now mature. On me the alteration was still more
      striking: and in the countenance of the dark-browned soldier, bronzed by
      climate, and marked with a sword-scar, it would have been difficult to
      recall the laughing features of the youth, whose morn was passed idly in
      the chase, and his evening in singing love-ditties to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Seigneur knew nothing of the world. The hunter boy was a safe
      companion for his daughter&mdash;the soldier a dangerous one. No suspicion
      crossed his mind. I again took up my residence in the chateau. Pauline was
      more than pretty; the place was sadly remote; we were both musical&mdash;youth,
      loveliness, and music! Pshaw! these cleared his way, and Love slipped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seigneur was rich&mdash;and on wealth he set great value. His lineage
      was old; and nobody in Provence attached more importance to descent. He
      had began to fancy that it would soon be time to look for an alliance for
      his daughter; and he occasionally made sly inquiries touching the ancestry
      and rent-rolls of his neighbours. Great, however, was our surprise, one
      afternoon, when he suddenly announced that he had nearly concluded a
      marriage treaty between Pauline and a wealthy proprietor. This
      information, at first astounding, only precipitated what would have more
      tardily occurred. We were married secretly, the next evening; under other
      circumstances, we might have been dreaming of it for another fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for us that the Seigneur was proverbially slow in all his
      movements; and his intended son-in-law equally cautious. Neither would
      stir an inch, excepting under the especial direction of his notary. All
      the time, the intimation simply that a hymeneal treaty was in progress
      being deemed quite enough to render Pauline a consenting party. The suitor
      was a fool, who considered every woman would feel honoured by being allied
      to him; and the simple Seigneur could never comprehend, that any daughter
      should or could do otherwise than what her father exactly pointed ont.
      Poor man! while he was arranging matters to secure a son, he would have
      come nearer to the mark, had he been making preparations for the reception
      of a grandaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in lovers&rsquo; dreams, Pauline and I saw day after day pass; and
      frequently, when we spoke of a discovery, which circumstances would render
      inevitable before long, we laughed and trembled at the effect it was
      likely to produce upon her father. It is true the event was somewhat
      distant; and as long as it were possible, the secret must be kept. But a
      more sudden blow was impending&mdash;it fell, and both were rendered
      miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever man were drunk with fortune, it was Napoleon. He had reached the
      highest pinnacle of human fortune, that the wildest ambition could soar
      to; yet, blinded by prosperity so dazzling, he was dissatisfied,&mdash;and,
      forming the most romantic projects, like a desperate gambler, he risked
      all that he had gained&mdash;&ldquo;wearied his good genius, and provoked his
      fate.&rdquo; In a word, he first commenced an unjust and impolitic war here, in
      the peninsula, and followed that madness out by a still madder act&mdash;the
      invasion of Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although for more than a year, the hostile attitudes assumed by Napoleon
      and Alexander, showed mistrust on both sides, few suspected that the
      crisis should come so suddenly. The remoteness of the Seigneur&rsquo;s estate&mdash;the
      little intercourse he held with any who knew what was passing in the
      world, left us in blissful ignorance. And the first intimation I had, that
      I was about to enter on a bloody and disastrous campaign, was a peremptory
      command to set out for Dantzic at an hour&rsquo;s notice. The sudden order
      prevented Pauline and me from taking any steps to communicate the secret
      of our marriage; and at the moment when woman requires the greatest
      attention from a husband, I was obliged to abandon the home of my youth,
      and her whom I had sworn to cherish and protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the routes through Germany were crowded with enormous masses of
      fighting men. Never, in modern warfare, was such an army collected and set
      in motion. Conceive more than five hundred thousand combatants, of all
      arms&mdash;including sixty thousand horsemen, and twelve hundred pieces of
      artillery! The very enormity of the vast machine would have required a
      superhuman mind to direct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not dwell upon the campaign. On we went!&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;on!
      as if urged by an overruling fatality. The Russians prudently retired&mdash;that
      was called fear&mdash;the weather for a few days was moderate; and our
      leader madly fancied that the horrors of the icy north were fabulous. Oh!
      how fatally that fallacy of his turned out!
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass the less interesting portion of this tragic campaign. The mind that
      conceived the monstrous undertaking, could not be sane. The haughty
      assumption of the Emperor struck many a thinking soldier as being
      incompatible with the statesman&rsquo;s prudence; and when assuming the mantle
      of prophecy, and in reply to a temperate appeal, exclaiming, &ldquo;a fatality
      involves them; let their destinies be fulfilled!&rdquo; he rejected conciliatory
      advances, and flung the scabbard from the sword, more than Talleyrand
      pronounced, that Fortune and he had shaken hands and parted; and the sad
      results of that mad aggression upon Russia proved its truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A circumstance occurred, that looked like an evil augury; and, to the
      superstitious, foreboded evil results. Although the month was July, at
      Pilony a rain storm nearly overwhelmed the men and horses of a whole
      division. Of the latter, several hundreds were lost; and at Lismori, a
      thunderbolt fell into the bivouac of the Old Guard, and destroyed several
      of our veteran soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the decree was passed; and our leader pushed forward where the finger
      of destiny pointed. At Witepsk, the enemy presented themselves in order of
      battle, after retiring, in perfect order, and holding every inch of forest
      through which we passed. That they were intimidated, was a manifest
      absurdity; their skirmishers held the ground boldly and freely,&mdash;mingled
      with ours as they advanced. From the audacity with which they awaited our
      approach, and singled out individuals, we lost some valuable officers; and
      in the very centre of his escort, General Roussel was pistoled by a
      Russian dragoon. It was evident that policy, not fear, induced the enemy
      to recede. In a cavalry affair, the next morning, a regiment of chasseurs
      were charged, and heavily cut up by some squadrons of the Cossack Guard,
      and nothing but the immediate support of an infantry corps saved them from
      destruction. Napoleon was a looker-on, and directed the movement by which
      the regiment was rescued.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the heights beyond the Lonchesa, we observed the whole Russian army in
      position. A battle would be received, and we bivouacked, waiting for
      morning, to fail on. At day-break we were, under arms. Where was the enemy
      we were to assail? On the preceding night, Barclay de Tolly had abandoned
      his position; and that, too, with so little precipitation, that the very
      route he took was doubtful;&mdash;neither dismounted guns, nor dead
      horses, pointing the line of his retreat. The youngest soldier, as he
      passed over a country ravaged and deserted, began to suspect the reason
      that a conflict had been declined. It was masterly policy; and the
      sacrifices it cost in the outset, were amply repaid in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period of the advance, we suffered dreadfully from heat and
      scarcity of water. Many a <i>veille moustache</i> asserted that an
      Egyptian sun was more endurable. Then, the weather would change suddenly,&mdash;rain
      fall in torrents,&mdash;and, from the difficulty of the roads, render
      marching almost impracticable. We thought our hardships severe enough.
      Little did we imagine those that remained in store!
    </p>
    <p>
      Smolensko was fought&mdash;and, after a doubtful contest, the victory was
      gained.&mdash;Gained! When the city could no longer be defended, the
      Russians fired it, simultaneously, in an hundred quarters; and the fruits
      of a bloody conflict was a town laid in ashes by the very men who held it
      so desperately to the last!
    </p>
    <p>
      On other points, the French arms were equally successful; and here it was
      believed that Napoleon would pause; organize Roland&mdash;hold Riga,
      Witepsk, and Smolensko,&mdash;and wait the return of spring. But, having
      dictated terms to the conquered, even in the palaces they had occupied&mdash;regardless
      of desert roads and coming winter, without magazines or hospitals, and,
      leaving the Moldwian army in his rear, he determined to march direct upon
      &ldquo;the sacred city.&rdquo; It was said, that the prudent of those around him,
      remonstrated strongly against this act of madness; but the Emperor&rsquo;s
      resolution was not to be shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      On we went; and the Russians, to cover Moscow, received battle on the
      heights of Borodino. With nearly equal numbers, two hundred and fifty
      thousand combatants were for twelve hours engaged in murderous conflict.
      Night ended it. The victors bivouacked on the ground they had gained at a
      sacrifice that shocks humanity&mdash;and the vanquished retired in perfect
      order, leaving the conquerors a field of battle. O God! such a field as
      the morning of the 8th disclosed!&mdash;sixty thousand dead or dying men,
      interspersed with five-and-twenty thousand horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the road to Moscow was open, but every step we advanced showed the
      madness of the proceeding. If we reached a town, we found it in a blaze;
      if we met a village, it was totally deserted. Cattle were driven off;
      provisions burned or buried; the peasantry had risen <i>en masse</i> and
      every man&rsquo;s hand was against us; but still our infatuated leader
      persevered in his mad career, and recklessly pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fondly supposed, that Moscow once gained, our hardships would
      terminate, and a winter of repose reward the privations we had undergone.
      That hope was false; Moscow, like the meanest village we had seen ruined,
      was also devoted to destruction. We entered it at noon; few inhabitants
      had remained; and none were seen in the deserted streets but a few felons
      who had left the jails, and some wretched outcasts of the other sex. Every
      dwelling, from the palace of the noble to the shop of the meanest artisan,
      was abandoned. The churches alone contained any living occupants, and they
      were the wounded only, or those whom age or infancy had rendered incapable
      of retiring with the remainder of its inhabitants from the doomed city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although an army was in the place, still it looked a splendid desert.
      Every soldier whom you met was loaded with costly plunder. It appeared a
      city of enchantment. Houses, splendidly furnished, invited the passer to
      go in; and he might have freely traversed every sumptuous room which the
      building contained, and met with nothing living. It was, in truth, a
      fearful picture of deserted magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, an alarm was heard. It was not caused either by secret surprise,
      nor an approaching enemy. At several points a dense smoke was visible;
      flames broke out in different quarters of the city; no water was to be
      procured, nor engines could be found; and a fearful rumour began to
      prevail, that Moscow had been determinately fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too true. By an act of desperate devotion, every private feeling
      had yielded to public necessity&mdash;the most extraordinary national
      sacrifice which history records was decreed and executed&mdash;and &ldquo;the
      sacred city&rdquo; was laid in ashes, by the hands of those who regarded it with
      a holy veneration, approaching to idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Napoleon the destruction of Moscow was a blow neither expected nor
      remediable. The stake, for which he played the wildest game, was at the
      same moment, won and lost. To reach the city of the Czars was the object
      for which he cast every prudential consideration to the winds&mdash;and
      what resulted? He dated a few despatches from the ruins of a city, to gain
      which two hundred thousand soldiers were to form the sad consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire momentarily increased&mdash;the wind rose, blew in a fatal
      direction, and the flames spread fearfully. There were quarters which the
      raging element had not reached, but incendiaries fired the houses, and the
      whole city was speedily sheeted in one broad blaze, far too irresistible
      for human agency to arrest. Then followed violence and rapine. Those of
      the inhabitants who had not removed, secreted themselves in vaulted
      cellars, or the remoter portions of their houses, most likely to afford
      concealment; while others remained before shrine and altar, trusting to
      their sanctity for protection. From all, the angry element obliged those
      unfortunates to retire. They were forced into streets where bands of
      drunken soldiers mingled with galley-slaves and robbers, launched by sad
      accident as a curse upon the world again, and maddened now by
      intoxication. With all the excesses of plunder, they mingled the most
      degrading and horrible debauchery. &ldquo;Neither nobility of blood, the
      innocence of youth, nor the tears of beauty, were respected. The
      licentiousness was cruel and boundless; but it was inevitable, in a savage
      war, in which sixteen different nations, opposite in their manners and
      their language, thought themselves at liberty to commit every crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night I never rested for a second. Though removed from the immediate
      vicinity of the conflagration, the lurid glare of the burning city
      penetrated the closet in which I sought repose, and female shrieks, and
      deeper cries of murder, fell loud and frequent on the ear. To add to the
      horror of the hellish scene, even animal sufferings were added. The
      watch-dogs, chained at the doors, had not been liberated: and as the
      flames reached them, their howlings were heart-rending.
    </p>
    <p>
      God forbid that I should ever witness such a scene again! The next day
      came. The fire raged more furiously than ever, and murder and violence,
      and every villany, continued. I strove, if possible, to fly from human
      crime and suffering; and in the evening found myself clear of the walls of
      Moscow, in a suburb totally detached, and, to all appearance, entirely
      deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, the houses were mean, and had belonged to the humbler classes,
      who live in the environs of a city. Here and there, houses enclosed with
      gardens and high walls were interspersed; and, as I afterwards understood,
      were residences of wealthy merchants, who neither would incur the expense
      or affect the display which the occupancy of nobler mansions within the
      walls demanded. I looked back&mdash;the city was in a blaze&mdash;a sheet
      of fire and smoke, by turns, as the flames were fed or smouldered. The
      lonely suburb, whither I had wandered, was deserted, but not ravaged.
      Indeed, here the plunderer would have only wasted time, when within there
      was so much to repay the most boundless cupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accident directed me: 1 turned down a narrow passage; a lane led to a
      garden-gate; it was open, and the ruins of wliat had been a pretty country
      house were visible. The garden was destroyed&mdash;the shrubs and
      fruit-trees broken&mdash;many hoof-marks were apparent in the soft earth;
      and litter strewed the ground, and showed, that the evening before the
      Emperor entered Moscow, an advanced picket had made, the chateau and
      grounds its bivouac. No living thing was visible; a dog-chain hung beside
      the door of the ruined mansion. Even that was a mute testimony of
      abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still looking at the deserted building, and fancying the happy home
      it might have been but a few days since, when a wild and piercing shriek
      was heard from the rear; and a young girl rushed from behind the house,
      followed by two Polish lancers, and both were infuriated with brandy. One
      seized her in his arms. I called on him to desist; but he held her with a
      firmer grasp, while his companion confronted me&mdash;and in a moment both
      sabres were unsheathed, and we commenced a deadly combat. Of the two, I
      was the better swordsman;&mdash;pressed the villain hard&mdash;and would
      have cut him down.&mdash;I heard a wild scream,&mdash;a blow from behind
      stunned me&mdash;a dreamy recollection followed of others fighting. The
      rest is blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke&mdash;where was I? Candles burned at my bed-side; and an old man,
      and a girl, particularly handsome, sate at either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; was my first question. The girl replied, in tolerable
      French, and assured me I was in perfect safety, and all around me were
      friends. Gradually, my memory came back; and in the young female at my
      side, I recollected her whom I had protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, that in the affray I had with the lancers, I had been cut
      down by a treacherous blow from the comrade of the fellow I was engaged
      with. The cries of the girl, and the clashing of sabres, alarmed the
      family, who came to my assistance too late to save me from injury, but in
      time to revenge, what they believed to be, my death. The villains were
      despatched without mercy&mdash;their bodies concealed till night, and then
      carried to a distance, and thrown into a sewer,&mdash;a necessary
      precaution, to prevent the suspicion that might arise should they have
      been discovered, and their deaths have occasioned inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was I? I looked around, and saw that the apartment was vaulted, and
      lighted by a lamp. Everything was not only comfortable, but luxurious&mdash;and
      Polowna&mdash;for so the fair girl who nursed me was designated, at my
      request explained the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father and kinsmen were merchants: and when Napoleon menaced Russia
      with invasion, with more forethought than was generally exercised, they
      prepared against a visitation that, though not probable, was still within
      the range of possibility. Beneath their country house, cellars of spacious
      size had been originally constructed, with a secret entrance, wherein to
      deposit merchandise which the Russian laws declared contraband. Though
      long disused, in this season of insecurity they were prepared for a
      different purpose. When the field of Borodino proved unsuccessful, and
      Napoleon approached the sacred city, Strenowitz, as the merchant was
      called, had everything valuable transferred from the chateau to the
      cellars; and having laid in all necessaries for supplying his family and
      servants during their confinement, the dwelling was apparently deserted,&mdash;and
      even those who resided in his immediate neighbourhood, believed that he
      had followed the example of the wealthier Muscowites, and removed into the
      interior. The destruction of the chateau, by the picket who had occupied
      it, added to the security of the family;&mdash;a ruined house held out no
      inducement to the plunderer; and, excepting the evening Polowna was
      surprised by the marauders who had wounded me, and paid the penalty with
      death, the concealment of Strenowitz escaped any visitation from the
      enemy, during the period that Napoleon continued to occupy his
      dearly-bought conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      My recovery was tedious,&mdash;the scull had been slightly fractured; and
      hence great care was necessary. Never was a soldier more tenderly attended
      to; and had I heart to spare, it should have been offered to Polowna. To
      quit my concealment would have compromised the safety of my young
      preserver; and, indeed, until after Napoleon abandoned Moscow, and
      commenced his calamitous retreat, I should not have been able to leave my
      couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late the Emperor found the terrible truth confirmed, to which he had
      hitherto obstinately refused credence. We could no longer remain in that
      ruined capital, which he had risked everything to obtain; and Lauriston&rsquo;s
      mission to Kutusoff proved a failure. The 22d of October was the day of
      our deliverance. The young guard retired from the ruins of Moscow; and, in
      an hour afterwards, a tremendous explosion announced that the last work of
      destruction was completed, and the Kremlin was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retreat of the invading army forms a frightful picture of retributive
      suffering. It shall be passed over;&mdash;one fact will tell its fearful
      history.&mdash;Four hundred thousand splendid soldiers, at the opening of
      the campaign, passed the Neimen: on the 13th of December, which may be
      taken as the termination of the retreat, scarcely twenty thousand men
      recrossed that fatal stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I had long since been reported dead; and when my health
      was sufficiently restored, when the exertions of my excellent protectors
      obtained my liberty, and I rejoined the skeleton of my regiment, I was
      looked upon by the few survivors as one returned from the grwe. But every
      league that brought me nearer to France seemed to remove a weight from my
      bosom, and my heart beat lighter. Pauline, in all her pride of beauty, was
      before my eyes&mdash;and in fancy, I was a father. I obtained leave to
      return home for the recovery of my health&mdash;and I hurried to that home
      where the smiles of my young bride would welcome me. Alas! Pauline was in
      the grave, and a broken-hearted old man and helpless orphan, occupied a
      dwelling in all the gloom of bereavement, which once was the abode of
      loveliness and plighted faith. I listened to the sad narration half
      stupified with grief. Pauline had confessed her secret marriage, and had
      been forgiven. The hour of trial came; and, at that dreaded moment, the
      intelligence of my supposed death was rashly communicated&mdash;and it
      killed her! Enough; I bore the visitation like a man; and when an order
      came to join a battalion of my regiment in Spain, I willingly obeyed it.
      You know the rest; and, but for you, if the dead are united in another
      world&mdash;as my heart fondly tells me that they are&mdash;I would have
      been with thee, Pauline!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped; a tear trickled down his cheek; and, to divert the sadness of
      his thoughts, I proposed that we should retire for the night. The host
      lighted us to a dirty and comfortless apartment; and, without undressing,
      we threw ourselves on the outside of the bed-coverings, and, wrapped in
      our cloaks, were speedily asleep. We were still fast as watchmen, when the
      guerilla roused us. For all, he had agreeable intelligence. There was a
      post established lately by General Laval, but two leagues off, occupied by
      a party of French lancers.&mdash;that the voltigeur could join easily. A
      few miles, in an opposite direction, a squadron of Julian Sanchez light
      cwalry were cantoned; and once with them, the fosterer and I would be in
      safety. Accordingly, after an early breakfast, we took leave of each
      other, each to follow out his respective fortunes, and, not improbably,
      meet again&mdash;upon a field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I must not forget: when summoned to the court-yard to mount our
      horses, we found the hidalgo and his friend, the little physician,
      settling accounts with the worthy host. On certain charges in the score,
      the parties held very opposite opinions. A long and bootless argument
      ensued; and, as disputants occasionally will part, the monetary
      transaction of the morning seemed to have raised neither in the estimation
      of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn I advanced to the landlord, paraded my purse, and demanded in what
      I was indebted for great hospitality, excellent wine, and a supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would kill the divil!&rdquo; was an addition of the fosterer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a profound bow, the host begged to leave the consideration entirely
      to myself, and forthwith I produced a guinea. I never saw joy so
      strikingly displayed: every line of the landlord&rsquo;s face expanded&mdash;the
      lip curled graciously&mdash;the eye sparkled; when a change as suddenly
      came over it, and the countenance at once changed to the very picture of
      despair. What could have caused this change? I turned my head. Immediately
      behind me the partida guide was standing, his finger in a monitory
      position, while his dark eye told the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; faltered the unhappy man, &ldquo;would I accept one real for
      any poor service I could show a dog&mdash;I beg pardon, Senhor,&mdash;a
      gentleman, who has the honour of Don Juan Diez&rsquo; acquaintance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guerilla motioned us to ride on. I did not look back, but a groan
      reached me from the doorway of the venta, as if a heart had broken. There
      was no mistake about it&mdash;the landlord was the sufferer!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he absolute
      authority exercised by the Partida leaders over the Spanish population,
      was apparent in the readiness with which their orders were obeyed&mdash;and
      of this, the independent style in which we had lived at free quarters for
      the last week, would have been a sufficient guarantee. Not contented with
      the demolition of his supper and the occupation of the state apartments,
      we found that &ldquo;mine host&rdquo; had been laid under farther requisitions, and
      obliged to remount the Frenchman and Mark Antony, whose horses were sent
      back by two villagers to the mountains.&rsquo; To a casual inquiry that I made
      touching the safe delivery of the animals, the guerilla, who accompanied
      us, replied with a stare expressive of surprise that a doubt should be
      entertained upon the subject; and then pointing significantly to his neck,
      he led us to clearly understand, that nothing insures punctuality and
      despatch like an occasional application of the halter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of an hour&rsquo;s ride we fell in with the party we expected, and
      our guide delivered us over to their safe keeping, That night we were
      entertained at the expense of an alcade, who loaded us with civilities,
      and would listen to no hint of ours touching remuneration in the morning.
      The extent of his hospitality, and the anxiety he evinced to anticipate
      our wants, drew forth from me a flattering eulogium. As I proceeded, the
      guerilla leader merely shrugged his shoulders&mdash;-and then privately
      assured me, that this generous functionary was one of the greatest
      scoundrels in the province, and that he was more than suspected of
      intriguing with the French. &ldquo;He fancies that he blinds us&mdash;no matter&mdash;we
      know him well&mdash;all I shall say, my friend, is&mdash;that for the
      horse you ride, I would not have my neck in the same insecurity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, we gained the crest of a hill which commanded an extensive
      view of the flatter country that lay beneath, and from a small wood, at a
      league&rsquo;s distance in our front, we perceived the smoke of a large fire
      curling upwards. The partida pointed to the spot, and told us that there a
      picket of light German cwalry was bivouaced, and therefore, that his
      escort was no longer necessary&mdash;then bade us a friendly farewell&mdash;and
      in half an hour the fosterer and I found ourselves once more within the
      allied outposts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On announcing myself to the officer in command as the bearer of a private
      despatch for Lord Wellington, I was furnished with a fresh horse and the
      escort of a couple of dragoons&mdash;and leaving the Empecinado&rsquo;s present
      to the care of the fosterer, I immediately rode off to reach head-quarters
      at Frenada.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed through the different cantonments, I fancied a general
      activity prevailed among the soldiers, which formed a striking contrast to
      the quiet and repose in which, a week before, I had left the allied camp.
      On the roads I had frequently encountered convoys moving in various
      directions, and the commissariat department seemed to be particularly on
      the alert. With an Irish officer, who was riding in the same direction, I
      entered into conversation for a few minutes, while I and my escort
      breathed our horses over a rough road that rendered a quicker movement
      dangerous; and from him I ascertained that the allied army was in perfect
      readiness, and it was the general opinion that &ldquo;Lord Wellington had
      mischief in his head!&rdquo; As he spoke, wheeling round a bending of the road,
      we came suddenly in sight of another that crossed it at right angles; and
      at a quarter of a mile&rsquo;s distance, observed a staff-officer, followed by
      an orderly dragoon, riding towards the point of junction at a pace which
      led me to infer that, like myself, he was the bearer of despatches. &ldquo;Talk
      of the devil,&rdquo; exclaimed my loving countryman&mdash;&ldquo;may the Lord forgive
      me for saying so!&mdash;but that&rsquo;s himself!&rdquo; The hint was quite sufficient&mdash;I
      spurred my horse, cantered safely over as rugged a causeway as man could
      meet with&mdash;reached the cross-roads&mdash;and halted at the point of
      junction, before the allied commander gained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On perceiving me pull up, Lord Wellington reined his horse in, and a brief
      colloquy ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Empecinado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven only knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To deliver a French despatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware of the contents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;we could not read it;&rdquo; and I placed the packet in his hand. At
      one rapid glance his eye ran over the secret characters&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I have the key,&rdquo; he muttered; then placing the document in his coat
      pocket, he desired me to ride on, report myself at head quarters, wait
      there for further orders, gave his horse the reins&mdash;and thus ended an
      interview that had barely occupied a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered the marked politeness which he had lavished upon Peter
      Crotty, and marvelled that his lordship had not the civility to even bid
      &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; to a gentleman, who had risked a broken neck to carry him a
      sheet-full of hieroglyphics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed the order; and intending to hold myself, in readiness, in the
      event of his lordship requiring any further information respecting the
      singular manner in which the intercepted despatch had been obtained and
      confided to me, was seeking some place wherein I might deposit my person
      in the interim, when whom should I stumble on in the street, but the
      fortunate object of the Great Captain&rsquo;s hospitality&mdash;Lieutenant
      Crotty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah!&mdash;murder&mdash;is it you?&rdquo; was Peter&rsquo;s opening inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him of my identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who would have expected to meet ye here?&rdquo; continued Peter; &ldquo;and what
      the divil druv ye back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I returned on an errand similar to your own on the morning of
      that auspicious day when I had the pleasure of first making your
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Crotty&mdash;&ldquo;for upon my conscience I
      forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more, than to transact a little private business with Lord
      Wellington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have ye met him yet?&rdquo; inquired Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely on the road; I expect, however, to be favoured with an evening
      interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; responded Mr. Crotty, &ldquo;a pleasanter gentleman ye never met. I
      hadn&rsquo;t time to finish my story; for I remember that ould bothering divil
      of a Colonel called me off. Well&mdash;when I rose to come away, he,
      that&rsquo;s Lord Wellington, says to me, &lsquo;Arrah, Peter, won&rsquo;t ye sit a little
      longer?&rsquo; &lsquo;Bad manners to me,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s more than I dare do.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;What a pity ye&rsquo;r in such hurry,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I suppose, however, it can&rsquo;t
      be helped at present; but the next time ye come, Peter, put ye&rsquo;r best
      breeches into your portmantle, and stop with us as long as ye can.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is his lordship generally so hospitable and polite to every body that
      drops in with a message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, upon my sowl! he&rsquo;s not. And if I swore it on a bag full of
      bibles, there&rsquo;s some of the divils here that wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. For one,
      there&rsquo;s Major Fitzmaurice&mdash;and, Holy Mary! now that I mind it&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
      he a whole bundle of letters for you! and he&rsquo;s in the town too.&mdash;Well,
      I&rsquo;m not bothered with letter-writin, and that&rsquo;s a comfort. What would they
      have to tell me from home, but that rack rents would be their ruin&mdash;and
      what could I say in favour of this villanous country, where, if a man at
      times happens to have a dollar in his pocket, he couldn&rsquo;t get a drop to
      wet his whistle, although it was dry as a lime-burner&rsquo;s wig, because the
      people have neither change nor daceney. But&mdash;see&mdash;there&rsquo;s the
      man I spoke about&mdash;and now, may the Lord bless ye, if it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
       So saying, and pointing out Major Fitzmaurice, Peter bolted round a
      corner, as he termed it, &ldquo;for a rason he had of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Major Fitzmaurice, I easily recognised the kind personage who had
      shared his tent with me on mv first appearance in cantonments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Peter Crotty, he also expressed much surprise at seeing me again,
      when, as it might have been supposed, I was <i>en route</i> to Valencia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a packet of letters for you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and in hope that I might
      meet with somebody bound for the east of Spain, I have carried them in my
      pocket. How fortunate to have dropped upon you! I came in to dine with
      some friends on the staff who are quartered in Frenada; and, if you have
      no better engagement, you shall join them with me, and in the evening we
      will return to the old shop. There it stands as formerly&mdash;the same
      mattrass and bullock-trunk&mdash;and &lsquo;ceade millia fealteagh.&rsquo; Talking of
      trunks&mdash;I saw Peter Crotty leave you. He has put a finish to his
      celebrated visit to Lord Wellington. Did he tell you of &lsquo;the portmantle,&rsquo; 
      as he calls it, and his &lsquo;best breeches&rsquo; into the bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these important facts were faithfully narrated to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come along&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you your despatches when I find my great
      coat; and by the time you have perused them, dinner will be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found, on opening the packet, four letters addressed to me, and two to
      the fosterer. Mine were respectively written by my parents, my uncle, and
      my mistress&mdash;and, may Heaven forgive me! love left duty in the
      back-ground, and Isidora&rsquo;s was the first seal broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely believe that the letter I perused was hers. Not a year
      since I met her a timid and retiring girl&mdash;she had never mingled with
      society&mdash;to her, man was strange&mdash;she blushed when addressed&mdash;and
      if she answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Back recoiled, she knew not why,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      E&rsquo;en at the sound herself had made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, girlish apprehension had given place to woman&rsquo;s firmness, and
      with gentle but modest sincerity, she repeated her assurances of
      attachment, told me how much pain my absence caused, and urged me, &ldquo;if I
      loved her,&rdquo; to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lady mother, of course, claimed next precedency. Her letter was dated
      from London&mdash;for thither she had proceeded, as it appeared,
      accompanied by her honoured lord. It breathed the warmest wishes of
      maternal anxiety for my safety&mdash;hoped, as I was ill a Catholic
      country, that I occasionally attended mass; hinted that my father became
      more intolerant, since the priest had cursed Mark Antony for his truant
      conduct to Biddy Toole&mdash;wondered what had brought them, meaning my
      father and herself, to England&mdash;and on this point, she seemed at a
      dead loss even to imagine what the object of their singular migration
      would prove to be. It had been suddenly occasioned by the receipt of a
      letter; and whether the poor dear Colonel was come over to speculate in
      the stocks, or raise a regiment&mdash;which latter might God forbid! the
      thing was equally mysterious. She had been introduced to a Mr. Hartley and
      his daughter&mdash;English Catholics, and the nicest people in the world.
      Would to Heaven, she continued, that, instead of following a horrible
      profession, in which body and soul were equally endangered, I would marry
      Miss Hartley&mdash;and, avoiding the dear Colonel&rsquo;s example, settle down
      for life with the general complement of legs and arms. There was an
      extensive repetition of affectionate rigmarole in prayers and wishes; but
      the gist lay, lady-like, in the Postscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember the gospel I bound round your neck. Preserve it&mdash;but open
      it only in extremity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s epistle was purely diplomatic, and couched in such general
      terms, that while they conveyed a meaning clearly, had the letter fallen
      into the hands of my grandfather&rsquo;s confessor, I question whether the
      Jesuit himself could have unravelled it. All, as he led me to understand,
      went prosperously. My parents were on the spot, and perfectly unconscious
      of the action of the drama. He, Mr. Hartley, wished me to return as
      quickly as I could with proper respect to character. He concluded with one
      comprehensive sentence&mdash;&ldquo;The cards play favourably&mdash;the crisis
      is at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had I expected to glean any information from my father&rsquo;s despatch, I
      should have been grievously disappointed. He had come to London, as he
      admitted, &ldquo;the Lord knew why.&rdquo; The mysterious present of 500L. had reached
      him in annual course, and the letter which enclosed it, conveyed a wish to
      visit the metropolis, that he deemed prudent to obey. To a Mr. Hartley, he
      had been especially recommended as a person deeply engaged in some secret
      proceedings, which might prove of important advantage to his family and
      himself. As yet, Mr. H. had not explained what these proceedings were;
      but, as he had assured him, the Colonel, that I was cognisant of all, and
      that in a few days himself should be fully informed on the subject, he
      had, for delicate reasons, forbore to press an explanation. The rest of
      the letter was rambling and unimportant. It detailed the cursing of Mark
      Antony, and his own feud consequently, with the priest&mdash;a
      disquisition upon out-post duty&mdash;attack in close columns, and
      movements by echelons. It then proceeded to state, that as Mr. Hartley had
      assured him that my stay on the Peninsula would be short, and my speedy
      retirement from the army a certainty, he, the Colonel, would recommend me,
      as I had lost my staff appointment, to decline going to the east of Spain,
      retire from the Twenty-seventh, and continue with Lord Wellington&rsquo;s army
      as a volunteer. I should thus see more service and sharp fighting&mdash;in
      my case a great desideratum. Acting independently, I might have frequent
      opportunities of distinguishing myself, which otherwise would only come in
      regimental routine. Every one expected that the next would be a splendid
      campaign. For his own part, he had hoped to have slipped over for a few
      months when the army took the field, but the bare hint at the intention
      sent my mother into hysterics. Here was a parenthesis about &ldquo;weakness of
      women.&rdquo; The whole concluded in his observing that, if I had luck, many
      opportunities might present themselves; but breaches, field-works, and
      defended bridges, were especially recommended for me to try my hand upon.
      The Lord might even send &ldquo;a forlorn hope&rdquo; in the way&mdash;that would be a
      happy chance&mdash;but then &ldquo;people must not be too sanguine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, more ingenious instructions forgetting a man securely shot, were
      never penned by an affectionate parent. The means were so easy and
      comprehensive, that I could have half persuaded myself that Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s
      steward and confessor had been of the number of counsellors whom the
      worthy Colonel had called in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just completed the perusal of my varied correspondence, when my
      friend the Major called for me, and announced that dinner was waiting. I
      accompanied him to another apartment, where I found half a dozen
      gentlemen, whose &ldquo;trade was war,&rdquo; congregated around a table less
      remarkable for correctness of appointment than solidity of fore. None give
      and receive a wanner welcome than soldiers upon service&mdash;I met a kind
      reception from all; and the meal and the evening passed pleasantly. There
      are few places where more singular characters are encountered than at a
      mess-table. We had one short gentleman, whose happiness consisted in the
      belief that he was always uncomfortable and superlatively wretched; and
      hence his conversation, from cock-crow to curfew, was an eternal <i>jeremiade</i>
      about dead mules and stolen bullock-trunks, tough beef and damp linen,
      with &ldquo;all the ills that flesh is heir to.&rdquo; He had been wounded in one
      action, and in the next charged and overthrown by a drunken dragoon, who,
      in the <i>melee</i>, mistook him for a Frenchman. In short, from friends
      and enemies, in common, he had received abominable treatment; and
      latterly, had narrowly escaped being poisoned, by drinking wine from a
      store-cask, in which, after an undisturbed possession of a week, the
      mortal remains of a drowned drummer had been unexpectedly discovered. On
      this evening, he feelingly related a recent atrocity perpetrated by an
      Irish batman, who had burned the only boot in his possession, in which an
      angry corn could obtain repose. He ended the lament with the customary <i>finale</i>
      to all his grievances; namely, an individual inquiry of, &ldquo;What the devil
      drove him to this infernal country at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine, my dear Neville, the gentleman you name had an active agency
      in driving us all here&mdash;if men would only speak the truth,&rdquo; observed
      Major Fitzmaurice. &ldquo;I fancy he was close at your elbow, Richards, before
      you quitted London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my elbow, certainly,&rdquo; replied the hussar. &ldquo;Had I kept that quiet, I
      should have been still doing duty at the Horse-guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I inquire, my young friend, what might have formed the immediate
      inducement of your favouring us with a visit?&rdquo; continued the Major,
      addressing a volunteer upon his right&mdash;&ldquo;Did you shake the elbow&mdash;teach
      tradesmen book-keeping&mdash;shoot a friend who differed with you in
      opinion?&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of these delinquencies have I committed. I am suffering for the sins
      of another,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Fitzmaurice; &ldquo;and your friend, the sinner, pays the
      penalty by proxy&mdash;very convenient for him but rather hard on you.
      Would you oblige us with particulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a short story,&rdquo; said the volunteer, with a smile;&mdash;&ldquo;An accursed
      cousin of mine paid some delicate attentions to the wife of his next-door
      neighbour; and, unfortunately, I was acquainted with the proceedings. &lsquo;A d&mdash;d
      good-natured friend&rsquo; informed the little doctor, that his lady and my
      kinsman were fitting him for a state of beatitude, and &lsquo;the injured
      husband&rsquo; commenced legal proceedings, to recover compensation for the loss
      he had sustained. Loss! To get rid of a regular virago, who lalopped him
      three days in the week, and made him miserable for the other four. Had the
      doctor possessed a spark of generosity, he would have given my wicked
      kinsman a service of plate, devil as he was! Well, though every body knew
      the truth, it was necessary to lug me in, as evidence, to prove it. &lsquo;If
      you appear,&rsquo; said the defendant, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be my ruin, Tom;&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;If you
      don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m done brown,&rsquo; said the doctor,&mdash;but to make all right, I&rsquo;ll
      get an <i>ne exeat regno</i>.&rsquo; Here I was in a regular fix&mdash;between
      my cousin and the chancellor&mdash;the devil and the deep sea.&rsquo; I had no
      alternative but to bolt at once, and come here, hurry-scurry, like a
      sheep-stealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, there is one thing certain,&mdash;the devil was at the bottom of
      your business. And pray, may I inquire why you, Sir, sought this <i>refugium
      peccatorum?</i>&rdquo; said Fitzmauriee, to a pale gentleman nearly opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed &ldquo;looked unutterable things,&rdquo; and sighed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;I see it. Nothing transportable,&mdash;not even suspicion of
      debt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pallid gentleman shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your sufferings are sentimental. Come&mdash;make a clean breast, and
      you&rsquo;ll sleep all the sounder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas woman&rsquo;s falsehood,&rdquo; returned the &ldquo;pale lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Julia, false as thou wert, this widowed heart shall never own
      another image than thine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was Julia, and what did she do?&rdquo; inquired the Major, with
      provoking insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; returned the desponding Lieutenant,&mdash;&ldquo;that secret
      shall perish with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;no matter; but what the devil did she do? Had she a kick in
      her gallop?&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the bereaved gentleman; &ldquo;I loved, and wooed, and won her,&mdash;as
      I fondly fancied. I urged my suit, and pressed her to name the day that
      should seal our mutual happiness;&mdash;I would have wedded her&mdash;but,
      alas! she left me for another. That, Sir,&mdash;ay&mdash;that fatal
      visitation, made me the wanderer and the outcast that I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; replied the Major, &ldquo;how heavily you took it! Now, is it not
      funny enough, that an occurrence, opposite as the antipodes, actually
      bundled me into the Peninsula a second time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! my dear Major,&rdquo;&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir;&mdash;the ease was desperate&mdash;and nothing but
      expatriation could have saved me from the bonds of Hymen. The lady would
      not be denied; and to escape connubial captivity, I levanted at an hour&rsquo;s
      notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the inquiry not impertinent, nor one that would painfully recall the
      past and probe the breast too deeply, I should feel curious to learn the
      particulars,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, my dear fellow, I have been, as you properly suspect, the victim
      of a too sensitive heart, and have suffered accordingly. But here goes to
      make a clear confession, and give you the leading incidents of my amatory
      adventures. I omit, of course, skirmishes of love with <i>femmes de
      chambre</i>, dress-makers, gentlewomen wayfaring in stage-coaches, or
      encountered <i>gipsying</i> a mile or two from Islington or the Elephant,&mdash;appertaining
      to the <i>corps de ballet</i>, or met with at a conventicle in the
      afternoon&mdash;sheltering in July, under a portico, from a shower, or
      lost in November, in a fog. I shall pass over all diurnal notices in <i>The
      Times</i>, beginning with &lsquo;should this meet the eye,&rsquo; and affairs
      transacted by the agency of twopenny postage. But why detain you? Fill,
      gentlemen&mdash;I fear you&rsquo;ll find the story very long, and, what is
      worse, very melancholy and affecting.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have ever been
      romantic. At twelve I wrote poetry&mdash;for by that name my grandmother
      was pleased to designate my melodies&mdash;and at sixteen was regularly in
      love. In two years more, I left &ldquo;England, home, and beauty,&rdquo; &ldquo;to seek the
      &ldquo;bubble reputation.&rdquo; Need I say what agony that parting with the fair one
      caused? How convulsively Clara sobbed, and how awfully I swore in return,
      when I received from her hand a ringlet&mdash;hue, sunny&mdash;binding,
      violet-coloured silk&mdash;which was duly deposited over the fourth rib&mdash;left
      side&mdash;with a solemn adjuration, that there the said ringlet should
      abide and dwell until the heart it covered had ceased to beat, and the
      lungs adjacent should exercise their expiring functions, in murmuring warm
      but feeble prayers for the happiness of the donor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nineteen I carried the colours of the &mdash;th into action at
      Salamanca, but I lament to say, that the honour of carrying them <i>out</i>
      was reserved for another gentleman of the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a d&mdash;d ill-looking tirailleur, covering me dead,&rdquo; observed a
      brother ensign, to whom &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s banner&rdquo; had been entrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m devilish, glad to hear it,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;for I thought the scoundrel
      was levelling at myself.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * True anecdote.
</pre>
    <p>
      My supposition was, unfortunately, correct; for before I had done
      speaking, a bullet broke the colour-staff, passed through the arm that
      held it, and took temporary possession of my person exactly opposite the
      spot, where the <i>gage d&rsquo;amour</i> of my absent Clara had been deposited.
      I dropped&mdash;two rear-rank men picked me up instanter&mdash;and, though
      the action was particularly hot at the moment, they insisted on bearing me
      from the field. The anxiety which these worthy men expressed for the
      safety of their officer was astonishing, and I think they would have never
      halted until we had been out of range of the Cadiz mortar, had the same
      mortar been in battery at Salamanca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil are ye going with the lad?&rdquo; exclaimed an eighty-eighth
      man, who was hobbling on as fast as a wounded leg would allow him, to try,
      as he termed it, to overtake his &ldquo;darling Faugh-a-ballaghs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To obtain medical assistance,&rdquo; responded both my Samaritans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye had better return,&rdquo; said the Ranger. &ldquo;Devil a doctor&rsquo;s within a
      mile of you, except an assistant surgeon, who is lying under yon wall in
      mortal alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My humane friends at once decided upon employing the gentleman lying under
      the wall, and I was accordingly committed to his care. &ldquo;Faint the din of
      battle bray&rsquo;d,&rdquo; and the doctor recovered his self-possession as the roll
      of musquetry became feebler and more distant&mdash;the ball was extracted&mdash;I
      was removed to the house of a gentleman immediately beside&mdash;confided
      to the tender mercies of any who would undertake them; while my deliverers&mdash;the
      greatest cowards who had ever been inflicted on a fighting regiment&mdash;considering
      the plundering had commenced, set out to try what industry would acquire;
      and, as I verily believe, the assistant surgeon &ldquo;bore them company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon my conscience, into a nicer family circle an Irish ensign never
      contrived to drop himself. The senhor was a steady, sober, respectable
      gentleman, who went regularly to mass, and never drank in the morning. His
      lady managed him, the farm, and the domain&mdash;rent of the latter not
      excessive&mdash;and the daughter&mdash;oh, murder! three years have
      passed, and as yet I have never managed to forget Agatha&rsquo;s foot and ancle!
      But then her eyes&mdash;St. Senanus could have never stood a second
      glance; her teeth would have put a foxhound&rsquo;s to the blush; and, as the
      old song goes,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Her hair was as flick as the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she nursed me&mdash;her mother offering at matins and vespers a
      prayer for my recovery and conversion, and her father spending the morning
      in asking after news, and putting the evening in, by giving me the result
      of his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight passed&mdash;and as one wound healed, another opened. Agatha
      was ignorant of French, I innocent of Spanish. &ldquo;With the exception of a
      monk or two in Salamanca, not a soul (out of the army) spoke Irish; and
      hence, poor girl! from a neglected education, we were rather puzzled to
      explain the rapid growth of mutual affection. In time we might have
      succeeded&mdash;but one fine morning in August, a field officer,
      accompanied by a staff surgeon, dropped into a neighbouring village where
      some sixty lazy vagabonds were malingering. Of course, they were all
      ordered to their regiments, and I, with a senior officer, desired to look
      after the scoundrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha!&rdquo; I said, as I held her to my bosom the morning that I marched,
      &ldquo;Agatha, would that I could remain in this sweet thraldom to eternity.&mdash;Curse
      that bugle! I wish to God the fellow had been shot through the lungs
      instead of the arm&mdash;Agatha!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here sobs broke in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat, Pat. Do you really regret to leave me? and will you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return in a month, and make ye Mrs. Patrick Fitzmaurice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself upon my breast&mdash;placed a little billet in my hand&mdash;inquired
      how many days in England we reckoned for September; when a gruff voice
      exclaimed behind, &ldquo;Mr. Fitzmaurice, Major Oldham is waiting to see the
      detachment march off, and if you&rsquo;re not at his elbow in a pig&rsquo;s whisper,
      why, he swore by the eternal frost! he&rsquo;ll report you to the general
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha, my own Agatha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat, my darling Pat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, last, kiss (vide the Corsair, for a particular account of a kiss
      of this description) succeeded&mdash;&ldquo;Fall in, men,&rdquo; said the sergeant,
      and in another minute poor Agatha was on the sofa, and I in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as I passed the window whence, &ldquo;like Nioobe, all
      tears,&rdquo; she watched the detachment move off, &ldquo;Agatha, on that festival you
      named, expect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s Tib&rsquo;s eve,&rdquo; * said an incredulous scoundrel, who overheard the
      promise&mdash;The bugler played Paddy Carey&mdash;an angle of the street
      intervened.&mdash;It was the last I saw of Agatha.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An Irish festival, which is said to fall &ldquo;neither before
     nor after Christmas.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When we halted for the night, I took the little packet from my breast and
      examined its contents. It contained a billet that professed eternal
      constancy, and a tress of glossy hair, black as the raven&rsquo;s wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Agatha, this memorial of our love shall rest beside that heart which
      is all thine own. But softly, Mr. Fitzmaurice! Is there not already a
      tenant in possession? Pshaw! Poor Clara! What fools boys are! Ha, ha, ha!
      and I <i>really</i> did fancy I was in love? One cannot help laughing at
      the recollection. Let me see&mdash;light brown&mdash;Well, the hair is
      pretty hair enough&mdash;but, shafts of Cupid! to compare brown with
      black!&mdash;the very thought is high treason in love&rsquo;s calendar. Still
      will I preserve a memorial of thee, my sweet <i>blonde</i>&mdash;and
      therefore, sunny ringlet, I&rsquo;ll commit thee to&mdash;my wilting desk!&rdquo; The
      transfer was effected, and the tress of glossy black promoted to the
      secret pocket of the jacket, in front of fourth rib&mdash;left side&mdash;<i>vice</i>
      light brown, &ldquo;placed on the retired list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A year rolled over&mdash;the anniversary of my birth came round. It was a
      sweet October evening, and I stole out from the crowded hall of my
      father&rsquo;s mansion to meet my gentle Lucy. All around was so calm, so quiet,
      and so lovely, that the coldest heart would own its influence, and even a
      professed woman-hater, for once renounce his heresy, and &ldquo;plead for
      pardon.&rdquo; And who was Lucy? The sweetest girl in Roscommon! Her father was
      the village curate, not passing rich on forty pounds a year but half
      starved with a wife and six children upon a hundred. Lucy was the eldest
      child, and when I left England three years before, she had promised to
      grow up particularly handsome. I returned&mdash;we met by accident&mdash;for
      her father&rsquo;s circumstances were too humble, and his spirit too high, to
      allow him to maintain terms of intimacy with my family. It was in one of
      those sweet green hint&rsquo;s, bounded by hawthorn hedges and overspread with
      apple trees, whose boughs bent under the load they bore, that I saw her
      for the first time after my return. If ever rustic-beauty was calculated
      to ruin a man&rsquo;s peace, it was such as Lucy Delmer&rsquo;s. A lovelier dice I
      never looked at&mdash;but it was its expression that did the mischief. The
      deep blue eye, that turned on the ground from man&rsquo;s approval the cheek,
      which one whispered word reddened to the very brow; those lips, which
      Suckling poetized and Cupid might have sworn by&mdash;but why dwell on the
      loveliness of Lucy Delmer? I came, I saw&mdash;reversed the proverb&mdash;and
      was conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The locality of my father&rsquo;s house was exceedingly remote, and so was the
      parsonage&mdash;and hence, though Lucy had numbered seventeen summers, the
      tale of love had never yet been heard. No wonder, then, that to my ardent
      suit her young heart was not indifferent. She did not tell me so&mdash;but,
      without much difficulty, I guessed the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was punctual to the hour.&mdash;The lane was made for lovers&mdash;so
      sweet&mdash;so unfrequented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand thanks, my sweetest Lucy, I feared this lonely spot might
      have alarmed you, and made you change your resolutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; with your protection, what had I to fear? But why were you so
      desirous to see me? I know there is a dinner party at the hall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my birth-day, Lucy&mdash;and before my last one, we carried
      Badajoz, by assault. From a soldier I purchased this chain, and have kept
      it as a memorial of that eventful passage in my nameless history.&rdquo; I threw
      it round her neck: &ldquo;And now, my sweet Lucy, the spoil of war becomes the
      bond of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Pat,&rdquo; said the blushing girl, in reply; &ldquo;would that I had some token
      to offer in return;&mdash;I am poor&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich, beyond Potosi,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;ay, and throw El Dorado into the
      bargain. These nut-brown tresses would manacle Dan Cupid if he came on
      earth, and replace Berenice&rsquo;s in hewen afterwards. Give me one lock!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;I hear footsteps.&mdash;Farewell, dear&mdash;<i>dear</i> Pat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu&mdash;dearest, <i>dearest</i> Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We separated. A villanous whistle was perpetrated at a short distance. It
      was a herd-boy of my father&rsquo;s&mdash;and as he passed me in the lane, I
      rewarded his melody with a thundering box, that changed &ldquo;Nora Crina&rdquo; into
      &ldquo;a lament&rdquo; that might have been heard a mile off.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when I retired I found a letter on my table, and broke the
      seal. Lucy&rsquo;s fair hand had indited the billet&mdash;and within was
      enclosed a lock of &ldquo;nut-brown&rdquo; hair, which Mr. Truefit of the Burlington
      Arcade (I forget the number) would have knelt to and worshipped
      incontinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy&mdash;my loved Lucy.&rdquo; I I exclaimed; &ldquo;little did I fancy, that from
      thee love&rsquo;s influence was to be learned for the first time.&mdash;<i>The
      first?</i>&mdash;Easy&mdash;Lieutenant Fitzmaurice, Saints and angels! &rsquo;tis
      the festival of the blessed Agatha&mdash;the very evening you promised, a
      year ago, to return to&mdash;&mdash;. Ah! Pat&mdash;Pat&mdash;What have
      you to say for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a special-pleader love makes man! In ten minutes, I had ascertained
      to my own perfect satisfaction, that in Agatha&rsquo;s case I had jumbled up
      gratitude with friendship, merely made a mistake, and called the mixture
      by a wrong name. It was quite certain that ny feeling for Agatha was only
      brotherly after all&mdash;and that night the secret drawer of of&rsquo; 
      writing-ease contained a second treasure; for the jet-black tress was
      safely deposited beside the brown one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This my third <i>liason</i> was short, but very ardent, while it lasted.
      Mr. Delmer discovered that we met&mdash;instituted inquiries&mdash;and
      learned the secret of our love. Well aware that an alliance with one whose
      only dower was innocence and beauty, would be objectionable to a family
      aristocratic in every feeling like mine, he delicately hinted the state of
      affairs to Sir Edward Fitzmaurice, and removed his daughter to the house
      of a distant relative. I had written for renewed leave of absence, as the
      original term had expired&mdash;and to my surprise received a refusal,
      point blank, from Colonel Markham, accompanied with a peremptory order to
      rejoin. The truth was, my loving father had written privately to the
      commander, and told him that I meditated matrimony with the daughter of a
      curate; and to that holy estate, the Colonel being an inveterate enemy, he
      readily became a consenting party to disturb our course of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week after I rejoined at Gort, I rejected invitations to tea, left
      the mess sober, and refused to be comforted. By night, Lucy&rsquo;s ringlet lay
      underneath my pillow&mdash;and by day, rested on a breast within which, as
      I religiously believed, the image of the loved one was enshrined to
      eternity. This extraordinary change on my part, excited a general inquiry&mdash;some
      opining that I had rats in the garret, and would require a gentle
      restraint and antiphlogistic regimen&mdash;while others asserted that I
      was about to turn Methodist, and were anxious to know whether I had
      attended field preachings, or been heard to swear since my return. Still
      my melancholy remained unabated, and I levanted before the third pint of
      wine&mdash;a proceeding in a corps of sharp drinkers, considered totally
      unregimental. Various were the surmises as to the ruinous results which
      this unhappy alteration in my habits must occasion. The assistant-surgeon
      suspected I might drop into a decline; and the red-nosed major added, that
      I would drop into Pandemonium afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period an event occurred that formed another epoch in my history.
      The captain of grenadiers, a pleasant gentleman, remarkable for
      taciturnity and an honesty of purpose that would warrant your drinking
      with him in the dark, in retiring from the mess-room to his lodgings in
      the town, with three bottles of Page&rsquo;s port under his belt and in
      Christian charity with all men, forgetting that an open cellar lay
      directly in his route, popped in head foremost, and was found an hour
      afterwards by the relief, dead as Julius Cæsar. By this deplorable event I
      got the step and the company together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the accident, Captain O&rsquo;Boyle came into my room to offer his
      congratulations. He lamented the loss the regiment had sustained. It would
      be many a day before the fellow of the departed could be found&mdash;a man
      who never bothered people with argument, confined himself to &ldquo;yes and no,&rdquo;
       and would as soon forge a bill, as pass the bottle without filling
      honestly. However, the Lord&rsquo;s will be done! It would have been all the
      better if he had taken the senior major. He, Peter O&rsquo;Boyle, would have got
      the step, and the removal of a toast-and-water man would have been a happy
      deliverance. &ldquo;Now I think of it, Pat,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I had a long chat
      with Miss Maginnis about you, at that tea party with the French name,
      which her mother gave the night before Bob Purcel broke his neck. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      dangerous to lewe cellars open with a drinking regiment in town, and men
      obliged to stagger home after dinner to their cribs. Well, you must know
      that Flora Maginnis is &ldquo;a regular clipper.&rdquo; You wouldn&rsquo;t match her in the
      province&mdash;takes a country side as the Lord has made it&mdash;never
      cranes a fence&mdash;thinks no more of four-feet, coped and dashed, than
      you would&mdash;sweet girl&mdash;no humbug about her&mdash;worst of it, no
      fortune&mdash;old Denis not worth a ghost&mdash;six hundred a-year&mdash;spends
      twelve. Well, as I was saying&mdash;&lsquo;O&rsquo;Boyle,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;what the devil
      sort of a spoon is that chap Fitzmaurice?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth!&rdquo; I mentally soliloquized, &ldquo;what would my gentle Lucy
      say, to hear her beloved Pat denominated &lsquo;a devil of a spoon!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The fellow,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;can neither ride nor drink, I hear; what is he
      good for? I wish to God he had broke his neck instead of that poor dummy,
      Bob Purcell.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad, Pat, I took your part like a true friend, and stuck to you like a
      brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By my oath,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;Miss Flora, you were, never more mistaken in your
      life. It would do your heart good to see him seated on the saddle. Why, he
      brought Marmaluke in, a beautiful second at Knockcroghary, and only he
      rode over a blind beggarman and broke his back, he&rsquo;d have won the cup in a
      common canter. Then, as to head&mdash;I never saw him fairly on the carpet
      but twice. He&rsquo;ll take off his two bottles without trouble, and troop the
      guard after it, steady as the serjeant-major.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And where the devil does the fellow hide himself?&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Dick,
      ye&rsquo;ll deliver a friendly message for me. Tell him I&rsquo;ll run him one round
      of the course for a new bonnet, weight for age,&mdash;and say, if he does
      not trot out to mama&rsquo;s <i>soirée</i>&mdash;ay&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name she
      called it&mdash;next Sunday, I&rsquo;ll go myself to his cursed den, and draw
      him like a badger. If I don&rsquo;t, may I never get a husband!&rsquo; There&rsquo;s no use
      refusing, Pat, for she swore, d&mdash;&mdash;n her if she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gentle Lucy!&rdquo; I ejaculated, &ldquo;no oath would fall from, thy sweet
      lips but the murmured vow of eternal constancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eternal what?&rdquo; responded Captain O&rsquo;Boyle, who had but partially overheard
      my rhapsody&mdash;&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Lucy Dogherty ye mean, I wish ye had been at
      the brag-table with her last Monday evening, when Mrs. Middleton laid down
      three natural aces,&mdash;Lord&mdash;she swore like a trooper. But you&rsquo;ll
      go to the <i>soirée</i>, as they call &lsquo;tea and turn out&rsquo; in this town, or
      Flora Maginnis will drop into your den, with a &lsquo;God save all here.&rsquo; What
      will I say about a round of the course? Pon my sowl! it&rsquo;s worth yir while
      to lose a bonnet, just to see how beautifully she sticks upon the pig-skin&mdash;&lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll
      come, won&rsquo;t ye, and I&rsquo;ll call for ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I may as well go with a good grace,&rdquo; I replied&mdash;&ldquo;your
      friend, Miss Flora, being a lady, &lsquo;not to be refused,&rsquo; as &lsquo;the fancy, call
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Give us a glass of water, with a sketch of spirits thro&rsquo; 
      it. I wonder what the divil tempts me to eat broiled bacon in the
      morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s request being complied with, he bolted the diluted
      alcohol, and presently took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the appointed night, he called and conducted me to the Sunday <i>soiree</i>
      of &ldquo;Mother Maginnis,&rdquo; as the mama of Miss Flora was familiarly termed at
      the mess. Why this maternal appellation had been conferred upon the lady,
      I could never exactly learn&mdash;but by that <i>soubriquet</i> she had
      been known for half-a-score years successively to every marching regiment.
      We found the company already assembled. Some played brag, some played loo,
      but Captain O&rsquo;Boyle led me direct to the piano, where, encircled by a
      crowd of red-coats, &rsquo;two ladies were playing a duet; and, on its
      termination, in due form he presented me to Miss Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was indubitably a fine animal&mdash;a handsome face, a splendid
      figure, and the most magnificent head of auburn hair imaginable. On
      Captain O&rsquo;Boyle announcing me as &ldquo;his friend, Captain Fitzmaurice,&rdquo; Miss
      Flora made a rapid inspection of my outer man from top to toe, and then,
      as if satisfied with the survey, she gave me a hand, white as alabaster,
      which I took respectfully in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Pat?&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it <i>Pat</i> they call ye?&rdquo; said the lady.
      &ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t ye shake my hand?&mdash;you take it as gingerly in
      yours, as if ye had hold of a hot poker. What do ye ride? Can you manage
      twelve stone without wasting, and on a ten-pound saddle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question at first sight?&rdquo; I mentally ejaculated. &ldquo;Ah! Lucy, my
      absent love, were thou and I together, ours would be a softer theme than
      ten-pound saddles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0389.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you play brag?&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. That old tabby, in black velvet, would cheat her
      father; and she, in the blue turban, rob a church. They play into each
      other&rsquo;s hands&mdash;client first, divide afterwards; they would do you
      brown&rsquo; to a moral in half an hour.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Flora, Flora,&rdquo; exclaimed her companion; &ldquo;how can you say such horrid
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re true,&rdquo; returned the young lady: then turning to me, she
      continued, &ldquo;Come away into the corner, and we&rsquo;ll have a quiet hit. D&rsquo;Arey,
      go find the back-gammon table, settle the men, and snuff the candles; it&rsquo;s
      the only thing you&rsquo;re good for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sheep-faced young gentleman instantly obeyed the order; and Miss Flora
      Maginnis and I sate down <i>tete-a-tete</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever there were two beings who differed from each other wide as the
      antipodes themselves, they were Flora aforesaid, and my absent mistress. I
      had endeavoured to imagine what &ldquo;a clipper&rdquo; was, according to the parlance
      of O&rsquo;Boyle; but my fancy sketch fell infinitely short of the original. An
      hour glided pleasantly away; and when supper was announced, Miss Flora and
      I proceeded to the table, mutually pleased with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had written to Lucy immediately on my arrival at head quarters, and for
      several days awaited an answer to my epistle with all the impatience of a
      lover. At last, the long-expected letter came; and my heart throbbed
      wildly when I read the post-mark; I pressed the billet to my lips,
      muttered that quotation from Pope, which insinuates that letters were
      invented in hewen, and broke the seal. The &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; commencement gave me
      a chill; and the conclusion, &ldquo;Your&rsquo;s, sincerely,&rdquo; froze me to an icicle.
      Indeed, a colder composition never met a lover&rsquo;s eye. It expressed
      gratitude for my sentiments of affection; spoke of the barrier that family
      and fortune interposed between us&mdash;followed that blow up with a
      disquisition on prudence and &ldquo;proper pride&rdquo;&mdash;declined all
      continuation of correspondence as irregular&mdash;and concluded with a
      belief, on her part, that &ldquo;it would be better for both that the past
      should be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I perused the letter, I found the colour waning on my cheek. Was this
      her constancy?&mdash;were these her sentiments? She who I thought had
      warmly reciprocated my love&mdash;she, whose whole heart I fancied mine
      for ever! Unconsciously my hand approached my breast; and ere I reached
      the cold conclusion of the letter, that ringlet, which a few minutes since
      a diamond would not have purchased, was torn from my bosom, and committed
      with that heartless billet which dispelled my dreams of lore, to the
      secret drawer, where brown and black lay quietly reposing. Fool that I
      was! I never suspected that a proud poor father had dictated every line.
      The hand was Lucy&rsquo;s; but had I looked attentively at the paper, I would
      have discovered that it was blistered with her tears. Alas! that fact I
      never knew for years, and not until Lucy was another&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every body knows, that the best preparatory state of mind a man can find
      himself in for falling in love with the first woman that he meets, is
      immediately after he has been piqued by the falsehood or indifference of
      another. My introduction to Miss Maginnis was therefore effected in the
      very nick of time&mdash;she seemed a godsend direct from Cupid.&mdash;Romeo-like,
      I changed from Rosalind to Juliet&mdash;commenced active operations
      against the heart of Flora, and fancied I could love her. We rode, and
      walked, and danced&mdash;ran one round over Breafy course&mdash;I was
      beaten by a neck; and on the following Sunday, Flora annihilated the
      devotions of half the congregation, by appearing at church in a
      lancer-cap, obtained &ldquo;per mail&rdquo; from Dublin, and, even by her enemies,
      pronounced &ldquo;a little love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this state of affairs an event occurred that brought matters to a
      crisis. A day never passed in which notes were not interchanged between me
      and Flora; and one fine morning, her maid was ushered in, and proved the
      bearer of a billet. As I fortunately preserved our correspondence, I can
      favour you, gentlemen, with faithful transcripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Pat,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you were drunk last night, and, in getting home found the street
      too narrow. What a humbug, to pass yourself upon people for a milk-sop! My
      aunt Packer will be married thirty years next Thursday; and as she
      annually recalls the memory of that misfortune, she gives, on the evening
      of that disastrous day, her customary hop. Will you drive me over? If you
      don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll get across in the Parson&rsquo;s rumble, and you may go to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       There was here a <i>hiatus</i> in the manuscript; but a fancy sketch of &ldquo;a
      gentleman in black,&rdquo; with his tail under his arm, enabled me to guess my
      destination. To this affectionate appeal I thus responded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Flo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you permit me to make a choice between &lsquo;the place below&rsquo; and your
      aunt&rsquo;s ball, I&rsquo;ll choose the latter. Set me down your man! I&rsquo;ll pick you
      up at eight, &lsquo;and no mistake.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to the hour, I called on the appointed night. Flora was true as a
      clock, and deposited her person and effects safely in the dog-cart. My
      horses were fast steppers; and in an hour and sixteen minutes, we reached
      my aunt Packer&rsquo;s. I am thus particular about <i>time</i>, for I backed
      myself against it, three to one&mdash;in kisses. Certainly I gave Flora
      sporting odds. She lost, as a gentlewoman should lose, came like a trump
      &ldquo;to book,&rdquo; and met her engagements honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached &ldquo;my Aunt Packer&rsquo;s&rdquo; domicile, we found that &ldquo;<i>more
      hibernico</i>&rdquo; the parish had risen &ldquo;<i>en masse</i>,&rdquo; to have a peep at
      the festive throng. With some difficulty I took my drag pretty safely
      through the crowd, removing only one toe in the transit&mdash;and having
      deposited Miss Flora in the hall, while she &ldquo;regulated her curls, and
      repaired damages&rdquo; generally, I fought my way to the assistance of my
      servant, who was making vain but desperate efforts to obtain standing room
      for the cattle in certain ruinous buildings denominated stables, which
      were crammed with a pleasing variety of quadrupeds; but by bribing one
      car-driver, and bullying another, who had spilled me the night before into
      a wet ditch, I induced them to remove their prads to some place else, and
      thus make room for mine. This exploit having been achieved, I entered &ldquo;the
      merrie hall,&rdquo; to claim my partner, who had intimated that she should await
      there my return, and honour me by making her grand <i>entré</i> on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ready for action when I reappeared; and as we passed through the
      mob of &ldquo;tinints&rsquo; daughters,&rdquo; who choaked the hall and staircase, nothing
      could be more complimentary than the remarks&mdash;That&rsquo;s Miss Flora
      herself,&rdquo; observed a redshank. * &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she the girl, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Redshank&mdash;a term applied in the kingdom of Connaught to
     young ladies who dispense with shoes and stockings.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s her sweetheart, I suppose, beside her.&mdash;Ogh! but they&rsquo;ll
      make a cliver couple,&rdquo; rejoined a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the match all settled?&rdquo; inquired an elderly gentlewoman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all as
      one, and just as sure as if the priest had on the vestment,&rdquo; was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, of course, these remarks were particularly flattering; but still to
      the matrimonial conclusion, I did not respond &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On ascending to the state apartment we found the company formally
      collected; and in the doorway observed a little man, very corpulent, and
      blessed with an efflorescent nose that would have brought eternal disgrace
      upon a water-drinker. He was dressed in a green coat with brass buttons, a
      speckled vest, and inexpressibles that once had been nankeen. I
      particularly noticed the tie of his white neckcloth. The bow was
      voluminous, and the muslin that encircled his throat affixed so loosely,
      that it was apparent the wearer had determined that his powers of
      deglutition should receive no interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Uncle Dick,&rdquo; observed my fair companion; &ldquo;no wonder that Aunty&rsquo;s
      so proud of her bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;r ye, Flo?&rdquo; said Mr. Packer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morrow! Dick,&rdquo; was the dutiful return. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that wid ye? Mr.
      Fitzmaurice, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a guess you made! If you go on this way, you&rsquo;ll be tried for
      witchcraft at last,&rdquo; said Miss Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fitzmaurice, ye&rsquo;r welcome&mdash;glad to see ye in Ballymaccragh. Fine
      night&mdash;but could drive over the bog. Maybe ye&rsquo;d step down to the wee
      back parlour, and have a glass of naagus, or a drop of the other,&mdash;naked,
      or in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of naagus, or a drop of the other&mdash;naked or in company,&rdquo;
       responded Dick&rsquo;s affectionate niece, mimicking her respected relation like
      an echo; &ldquo;do you think Captain Fitzmaurice drove thirteen miles to drink
      hot <i>scalteeine?</i> One would suppose you kept a potheine house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wanted to introduce him to the naabors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The naabors!&rdquo; returned the young lady, mimicking Uncle Dick to the life.
      &ldquo;And a blessed lot the neighbours are! Kelly, and Brophy, and Kinsella,&mdash;a
      parcel of savages, who only know when whisky&rsquo;s over-proof, and a bullock
      fit for market. But, Dick, why don&rsquo;t you take heart when you are in
      Athlone, and treat yourself to a new pair of fye-for-shames? And look at
      his cravat!&rdquo; so saying, she caught the ample bow, and whisked it round,
      until it met the spot where the hangman would have placed it. &ldquo;Now, be
      off, Dick; keep yourself and <i>naabors</i> out of my sight for the
      evening, and I&rsquo;ll settle sixpence a-day on you for life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think our introduction to &ldquo;my aunt&rdquo; was about as affectionate and
      reverential; and I began to comprehend the meaning of the word &ldquo;clipper.&rdquo;
       No matter; she was the finest animal in the collection; and what was it to
      me, if she denounced the scarlet turban of the lady hostess, and traced
      its importation to the same ship that, thirteen years before, had wafted
      Uncle Dick&rsquo;s unmentionables from China? We laughed at the company and
      ourselves, flirted, danced three sets before supper, two <i>ditto</i>
      after it,&mdash;passed every thing, next morning, on the road&mdash;and I
      popped her down at her papa&rsquo;s, at half-past seven&mdash;she to dream of
      marriage, and I of God knows what.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o&rsquo;clock before I toddled into the mess-room. Others had been
      nearly as late as I; for the little snub-nosed major and Captain O&rsquo;Boyle
      were just concluding their breakfast, when I joined them, and ordered
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cursed nuisance country routs,&rdquo; growled the short commander;&mdash;&ldquo;horse
      kicked by a vicious mule&mdash;kettle not boiled after supper&mdash;rheumatism
      left hip&mdash;and lost three rubbers at whist, and five pound ten at <i>lammy</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egad! for my part, major, I was delighted with Mother Packer, and my
      Uncle Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many true words said in jest; I&rsquo;ll bet five pound he&rsquo;s your uncle in a
      month&mdash;and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle?&rdquo; I returned, with a stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;double the bet, too;&mdash;d&mdash;d quick promotion yours&mdash;Captain,
      first week in the month&mdash;Benedict, two gazettes afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, I do not comprehend you. Pray, my dear major, what are you
      driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving at?&mdash;aye, last night&rsquo;s drive settled all. When do ye come to
      the scratch? All friends here;&mdash;no use in humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what the devil do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean&mdash;get your neck into the halter&mdash;slow march up the aisle&mdash;she
      looks down, and you delighted&mdash;Parson reads &lsquo;love, honour, and obey,
      <i>clerk cries</i> &lsquo;amen,&rsquo;&mdash;kiss your bride&mdash;chariot and four&mdash;white
      favours&mdash;boys shout&mdash;door shuts, and away ye go! That&rsquo;s the time
      of day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A graphic picture, major. But who are to be the <i>dramatis personae?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? yourself to be sure; aided and abetted by Flo Maginnis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marry! My dear major, <i>when</i> have I been pronounced insane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insane&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;parson says it&rsquo;s an honourable estate&mdash;bound
      to take his word. But I wish to God you would get your worthy uncle to put
      a few slates upon the stable&mdash;horse running at the nose, this
      morning, as if he had the glanders&mdash;Air, excellent thing but, d&mdash;n
      me, half the roof off, too much. I&rsquo;ll just toddle down to the postoffice&mdash;coach
      by this time in&rdquo;&mdash;and Major Belcher took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when he was gone, I requested Captain O&rsquo;Boyle to tell me what
      he had been hinting at; and I had the agreeable satisfaction to learn that
      my immediate union with Miss Maginniswas pronounced certain. Aunt Packer,
      on being assured by him, the captain, that I was not a confirmed drunkard,
      as she had heard formerly, observed that &ldquo;Flora had got out of bed with
      her right foot foremost, the morning that she met me,&rdquo; insinuating
      thereby, that Flora had been in luck; and, after our departure, Mr.
      Packer, in a neat and complimentary speech, had proposed our health and
      happiness, with an other, on his part, to bet five pounds that he would be
      a grand-uncle within the twelve month.&mdash;&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the serjeant,
      with the letters. Any news, Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; responded the serjeant, &ldquo;but a draft of a captain, two
      subalterns, and sixty rank and file, for first battalion&mdash;off
      immediately&mdash;transports waiting at Cork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected intelligence changed the current of our conversation.
      O&rsquo;Boyde went out to ascertain what names were first upon the roaster&mdash;and
      I retired to my barrack-room, to inquire whether I was really on the eve
      of matrimony, or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been for above an hour in a state of dreamy confusion, when a light
      tap was heard at the door. I announced myself at home&mdash;and in came
      Sibby Callaghan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! pretty one&mdash;is it you? Come here&mdash;give me a couple of
      kisses first, and then tell me how your mistress is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, captain. Oh! murder&mdash;if Miss Flora only knew it. Feaks&mdash;joking
      apart, it&rsquo;s a shame and scandal, and you going to be married in a week or
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married! Sibby.&mdash;Who the devil put that folly in your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it all. Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Dominick, the master&rsquo;s brother, and Tom, and
      Peter Blake, and their sister Emily, and Julia Dwyer&mdash;they call her
      Julia, but her right name&rsquo;s Judy&mdash;ay, faith, and a dozen more blood
      relations&mdash;arn&rsquo;t they all written for? But I must run down to Miss
      Byan&rsquo;s, the milliner; and maybe you&rsquo;ll have an answer for this note ready
      for me, at my return.&rdquo; And off went Sibby Callaghan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In desperate trepidation I broke the fair one&rsquo;s billet, and an auburn
      ringlet, silky and glistening, fell from its envelope upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Pat,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lock of hair you turned around your finger when you stole a parting
      kiss, this morning&mdash;&lsquo;Will you for my sake keep it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse upon parting kisses,&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to that beast Brophy, to whom my father gave some
      encouragement, to say that, like a dead heat, the match was off. Would you
      wish to see the letter, before I send it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up for coffee. We&rsquo;ll have a quiet chat&mdash;and, like a dear good
      boy, go to roost early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thine,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo; I muttered. Was ever man run into matrimony so
      ridiculously? What&rsquo;s to be done? Knock again,&mdash;&ldquo;come in.&rdquo;&mdash;And
      in slided Captain O&rsquo;Boyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; was his opening address, &ldquo;have ye seen
      a ghost&mdash;or received a call from the sub-sheriff? or&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse&mdash;worse,&rdquo; I responded, with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be married, whether I
      will or not. Nothing can save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I expected it,&rdquo; returned the captain. &ldquo;Then, of course, you&rsquo;ll
      leave the regiment, and poor Phipps has no chance of getting you to take
      his turn for the Peninsula?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chance!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready in half an hour. Aye, that&rsquo;s an
      opening for escape. But stop; I must answer a note. There&rsquo;s cherry-brandy
      in the cupboard,&mdash;take a glass, O&rsquo;Boyle, and hand me another, merely
      to keep you in countenance. So here goes&mdash;listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dearest Flo,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall ever treasure the dear ringlet you have given me, and, no matter
      where I am, shall look upon it as love&rsquo;s talisman.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain O&rsquo;Boyle,&mdash;&ldquo;what the devil&rsquo;s a talisman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;hang it! no matter.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know what myself&mdash;but a
      word, very commonly introduced into tender correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As to that beast Brophy, as you properly term him, I feel some delicacy
      in offering an opinion. Were I he, I should at once accept your
      proposition, and declare &lsquo;off by mutual consent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If possible, I shall be with you for coffee, and attend to your advice
      religiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Flo,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Always yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pat.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had scarcely sealed my billet when love&rsquo;s messenger announced herself.
      The presence of Captain O&rsquo;Boyle precluded any converse between me and the
      spider-brusher; and after receiving her despatch, Sibby Callaghan
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at once decided that I should levant that very evening, leaving the
      detachment to the care of the subalterns, whom it was arranged I should
      join in Cork. Captain O&rsquo;Boyle discharged my accounts in town; my servant
      packed my traps; and I had stepped down to take a little air in the
      barrack-yard, when once more Sibby Callaghan presented herself. She placed
      a billet in my hand; I squeezed hers in return&mdash;whispered I would
      send an answer when evening parade was over&mdash;and broke the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Pat,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I misunderstood you? Then is my peace of mind gone for ever! Oh no&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t believe it. You would not win a virgin heart, and throw it idly from
      you! Rest assured, idol of my soul! that there is no bliss in life
      comparable to wedded happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, and yours only,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Flora.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote an immediate reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Flo,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain your estimate of connubial fidelity is correct; but at
      present, you must excuse me from trying the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always and affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it,&rdquo; said Captain O&rsquo;Boyle, &ldquo;you must be clean out of the town,
      before Flo gets that choker. The whole gang will be collected in the
      evening. But, Lord! she wouldn&rsquo;t wait for any assistance, but beat up your
      quarters at once. There&rsquo;s only a serjeant&rsquo;s guard at the gate, and that
      would never keep her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What is valour to discretion? Captain O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s were the words of wisdom,
      and I profited by them accordingly. A chaise and four were slyly
      introduced through the back entrance to the barrack&mdash;the gates closed
      for half an hour&mdash;and before Flora received my note, I had left Gort
      six miles behind, and set pursuit at defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you believe it? until I reached head-quarters here, I felt
      particularly uncomfortable. Conscience upbraided me; and I fancied the
      probability of an ill-regulated but too ardent temperament like Flora&rsquo;s
      being forced into the commission of some desperate act; and when I
      unclosed my secret depository, I looked at the auburn ringlet, and
      breathed a fervent prayer that Heaven would enable the poor girl to bear
      up against her visitation. As it resulted, I had disquieted myself in vain&mdash;for
      three week&rsquo;s ago, I received a Roscommon Journal, with &ldquo;P. O&rsquo;B.&rdquo; written
      upon the corner of the envelope. I looked it over rapidly; and one
      paragraph at once set my heart at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Cloonflin church, by the Reverend Doctor Dowdell, Ignatius Brophy,
      Esquire, of Curnafin, to the elegant and accomplished Flora Maginnis, only
      daughter and heiress of Dennis Maginnis, of Ballybawn, County of
      Roscommon, and Ballynamudda, County of Mayo.&rdquo; It was regularly recorded
      who gave the bride away, and also the route they took to spend the
      honey-moon; but I&rsquo;ll not be too particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the gallant major ended, a servant entered and whispered in the
      president&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wanted,&rdquo; he said, turning to me. &ldquo;You will be sure to find us
      here on your return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose and left the room; and outside, found an orderly waiting in the
      street, to say that Lord Wellington wished to see Lieutenant O&rsquo;Halloran
      immediately.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. MY INTERVIEW WITH LOUD WELLINGTON AND FURTHER PARTICULARS
      TOUCHING PETER CROTTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Falstaff</i>. &ldquo;Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain
      of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to vent any thing that
      tends to laughter, more than I invent, or is invented on me: I am not only
      witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.&rdquo;&mdash;King Henry
      IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>lthough the
      evening was well advanced, all within and without the quarters of the
      Commander-in-chief indicated a business-like activity, and gave a silent
      earnest that an important crisis was at hand. Three dragoons, the bearers
      of as many despatches, were riding on to their stables&mdash;while a
      couple of orderlies lounged backwards and forwards in front of the
      building; but excepting the sentries at the door, there was nothing about
      the residence of Lord Wellington that would distinguish it from the
      quarters of a general of brigade. On my name being announced, I was
      conducted into a large room on the ground floor, where at one table
      several noncommissioned officers were employed in transcribing official
      documents&mdash;and at another, two engineers were measuring distances on
      a large map, from which they were making, what appeared to me, a skeleton
      draft of the great features of the country. In a few minutes an
      aid-tie-camp came in, and informed me that his lordship was now engaged,
      but that he would be happy to receive me presently&mdash;politely invited
      me to take a seat&mdash;and then left me to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never found an establishment that so little realized the glowing picture
      which Peter Crotty had so fancifully sketched. From his report, one would
      have imagined that head-quarters had been the selected home of social
      pleasure, with &ldquo;Laughter holding both his sides,&rdquo; and Bacchus aiding and
      assisting. I found it a very different concern; and had the domicile
      belonged to La Trappe, business could not have been carried on more
      quietly than it was. The serjeants seldom raised their heads from the
      table&mdash;the engineers conversed in whispers&mdash;and the place was as
      silent as the clerk&rsquo;s office of a solicitor, with the head partner in bad
      temper in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I fancied that there might be a secret symposium unapproached by the
      <i>profanum vulgus</i>, and to which none but the elect, with a favoured
      few like Peter Crotty, gained an entrance. Yet it was marvellous how well
      they managed matters in the house. No sound of distant merriment fell upon
      the ear&mdash;no explosion followed &ldquo;the jest which set the table in a
      roar.&rdquo; The walls must be confoundedly thick, or the company singularly
      prudent&mdash;you could have heard a cat cross the floor&mdash;and yet not
      an outburst of &ldquo;tipsey jollity&rdquo; was audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While lost in vague surmises as to the causes which might have occasioned
      this strange alteration in his lordship&rsquo;s style of living since Peter
      Crotty had favoured him with a call, a servant opened the door, and
      requested Lieutenant O&rsquo;Halloran to follow him. We crossed over to an
      opposite apartment&mdash;the attendant announced my name&mdash;and I found
      myself in the presence of him afterwards surnamed, the &ldquo;Iron Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never was more surprised than at the general appearance of my lord&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;great chamber.&rdquo; Neither bottle nor glass were to be seen&mdash;the cards
      eluded discovery&mdash;and I could detect nothing in &ldquo;the sporting line&rdquo;
       except one solitary chess-board. The apartment contained not one article
      that could have been dispensed with. The table was over-spread with papers&mdash;and
      at one end, an aid-de-camp copied letters&mdash;at another, a private
      secretary wrote from the dictation of the Commander-in-chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. O&rsquo;llalloran,&rdquo; said his lordship&mdash;&ldquo;we have deciphered
      your despatch&mdash;and the information it contains is very valuable. May
      I inquire under what circumstances the packet fell into Juan Diez&rsquo; hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I briefly narrated the particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is genuine, no doubt; indeed it bears the stamp; but documents have
      been occasionally fabricated, which have misled people who did not take
      pains to test their authenticity. You appear to have had a good deal of
      adventure during your <i>séjour</i> with the Empecinado. They say that Don
      Juan is an off-handed gentleman at times&mdash;hangs a man first, and
      makes inquiries afterwards&mdash;ha?&mdash;Is it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As far as I can judge, my lord,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;such is his general
      practice. I found him a very excellent friend; but he&rsquo;s the last man in
      Spain whom I should wish to make an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that his lordship was interested in the details of my recent
      adventures, which pictured strikingly the wild and ferocious style of war
      which the partidas carried on. Once or twice he was pleased to pay me a
      compliment; and he expressed unqualified satisfaction at Mark Antony&rsquo;s
      bold and successful intervention to save the condemned voltigeur. Half an
      hour slipped away, coffee was brought in, and I was about to take my
      leave, when, turning round, as if a thought had struck him suddenly, Lord
      Wellington observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a comrade of your name,&mdash;whether now dead or living I know
      not. We served together in the Low Countries, and both commanded regiments
      during the retreat. At Tuyl he particularly distinguished himself&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on the occasion,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;lost an arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same;&mdash;is he related to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my father,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, you are the son of a good and gallant soldier, he
      retired from the service I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years ago, my Lord. But he is still in heart the same. Were it not
      for my mother&rsquo;s influence, I am persuaded that, one-armed as he is, he
      would have been with your lordship before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he was,&mdash;and, maimed as he is, I will freely take him, and
      give in exchange half-a-dozen gentlemen of his own rank, and with the
      usual assortment of limbs.&mdash;I am pretty certain I should be a-gainer
      by the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fearful of intruding upon his time, I bade Lord Wellington goodnight,&mdash;received
      a courteous return&mdash;and hastened back to the company I had quitted,
      highly flattered with the reception I had met with, although neither
      offered a glass of wine, pressed to play cards, nor even desired, when I
      came again, &ldquo;to bring my portmantle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night I returned with Major Fitzmaurice, and took up my old quarters
      in his tent; and as we smoked a cigar and discussed some brandy and water,
      I gave him an account of my interview at head quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reception, my dear O&rsquo;Halloran,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;though not so
      friendly as Mr. Crotty&rsquo;s, was still very flattering indeed. What a
      revolution his Lordship&rsquo;s habits have undergone within one brief month! He
      seems to have booked himself against cards, and abandoned brandy and water
      altogether. It would also appear that, finding &ldquo;villanous company would be
      the spoil of him,&rdquo; he has exchanged his old acquaintances for a lot of
      less sporting characters. And yet how the world may be led astray. There
      are people who would persuade you that Picton never touched pasteboard in
      his life, and that Packenham would as soon take poison, as &ldquo;brandy
      without.&rdquo; Ah&mdash;Peter, Peter, thou hast no parallel,&mdash;the brain to
      fabricate such a lie&mdash;and the brass to enable thee to give it
      utterance! Well&mdash;we&rsquo;ll put him on the gridiron tomorrow, and if he
      bears the scorching, why he deserves the first company that falls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, the fosterer and my charger arrived safely; and, with Major
      Fitzmaurice, I consumed the day in wandering over the cantonments.
      Unpractised as I was in military affairs, I could not but observe the
      striking contrast which the Peninsular regiments presented to that raw
      soldiery, whom I had been accustomed to look at, before I quitted England.
      Here, the unfaded uniformity of dress was wanting; not two jackets were of
      one shade; trowsers were patched with any colour the wearer could procure;
      and, provided his shoes were good, his appointments clean, and his musket
      in efficient order, the other externals of the soldier were but little
      regarded. But it was when under arms that the superiority of that
      unequalled army was observable. The ease with which it moved&mdash;the
      precision of every evolution&mdash;the facility with which a brigade
      manoeuvred, correctly as it were a single regiment&mdash;while an air of
      confidence was traceable on very face, and the whole looked like men who
      had made the trial&mdash;established, and felt their superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when we returned; the dinner-drum had beat, and we found our
      rough but happy circle already united around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our homely fare was speedily discussed, and the evening carouse began.
      There is no society on earth like that collected in a mess-room, or one in
      which men unbend with such security, and where the tone or temper of every
      individual is imperatively required to accommodate its peculiarities to
      the occasion, and harmonize with all around. Hence, in military
      communities, badinage never becomes coarse, argument captious, nor
      language vulgar and offensive. On the present occasion, my unexpected
      return was warmly welcomed, and all seemed to take a brotherly interest in
      my recent deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my conscience,&rdquo; observed Peter Crotty, &ldquo;ye had the luck of
      thousands, after all, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran. As to that fellow with the hard
      name, and black wized complexion, though he made ye a present of a stolen
      horse, in my mind, he&rsquo;s little better than a common highwayman. Did ye see
      my Lord last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I replied, carelessly. &ldquo;Was he in good humour?&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And asked you to sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did&mdash;most civilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any drink going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wonder at it!&rdquo; said Peter, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Probably his lordship had been a little too liberal the night
      before,&rdquo; observed the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any company wid his lordship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, Peter,&rdquo; responded the major. &ldquo;An aid-de-camp told Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran,
      that the card-parties had been postponed until your new breeches arrived
      from England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard another story,&rdquo; observed Captain Fenwick. &ldquo;They say&mdash;God
      knows whether it be true or false&mdash;that Sir Thomas Picton got a bad
      dollar in change the night Crotty got drunk at head-quarters&mdash;and
      Peter being the only suspicious person in the room, they have, of course,
      left it at his door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crotty appeared a little fidgetty; but still continued to show fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to hear the last statement made by Captain Fenwick,&rdquo; returned
      Major Fitzmauriee.&mdash;&ldquo;Any inconvenience arising from the non-arrival
      of Peter&rsquo;s inexpressibles, would have been but a private concern&mdash;but
      passing bad dollars is a more serious affair, compromising, as it does,
      the honour of an old and distinguished regiment. If the report be true,
      that Peter palmed off base money upon Sir Thomas Picton, why, he&rsquo;s nothing
      better than what the swell-mob call &lsquo;a smasher&rsquo;&mdash;and the offence is
      additionally aggravated, because that, under a conviction he was playing
      with respectable men, Sir Thomas thought it unnecessary to ring the dollar
      on the table, as if he were in a silver hell.&mdash;But where are you
      going? I know you are on duty&mdash;but, hang it, Peter, you need not
      visit your guards this half-hour. Oh, Peter, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, this
      evasion on your part looks very like guilt&mdash;and if you don&rsquo;t clear
      the matter up satisfactorily in the morning, I&rsquo;ll apply for a regimental
      inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; said a lieutenant of light infantry. &ldquo;Of all Peter&rsquo;s flights
      of fancy, that jollification at head-quarters will prove the most fatal.&rdquo;
       Turning to me he continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Crotty, Mr. O&rsquo;llalloran, is one of the best men on earth; and all
      he requires is, to meet with a true believer. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed at some of
      his revelations&mdash;he&rsquo;s not so truculent as at times he represents
      himself. For example: he&rsquo;s pleased to make frequent mention, when he has
      dipped into the second bottle or fourth tumbler, as the case may be, &lsquo;of
      having once pursued an unfortunate author on the banks of the Suir for a
      whole summer&rsquo;s day, and despatched him with the thirteenth shot. Of
      course, on his own showing, you would write him down a determined
      murderer.&mdash;Not at all. I believe the most rascally scribbler that
      ever blotted paper, might live to four score, and Peter never volunteer to
      be his executioner. The fact is, that in the pleasant part of Tipperary
      which witnessed the nativity of our friend, it is customary, when a couple
      of t&rsquo;s come together, to change the second into an h, and hence it was an
      <i>otter</i>, and not an <i>author</i>, that he put to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will bear testimony,&rdquo; said Captain Fenwick, &ldquo;to Peter&rsquo;s gallantry.
      When I was knocked down at Podrigo, and lay at the foot of the great
      breach, I saw honest Peter crown it&mdash;and with some dozen hair-brained
      devils, like himself, he fought on the summit, hand to hand. The French,
      when the lesser breach was carried, gave way&mdash;the town was won&mdash;and
      Peter, with a fortunate few, gained the streets without sustaining
      personal injury. Two days afterwards he visited me in hospital, bitterly
      lamenting the total loss of a skirt, which had been bodily removed by a
      bayonet thrust. &lsquo;Bad luck to him for an unlucky thief!&rsquo; was Peter&rsquo;s
      indignant observation. &lsquo;He tattered the only jacket that I had; and though
      the tailor has been on the look-out ever since, the devil a skirt he can
      fall upon that will match it!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; observed the assistant-surgeon, &ldquo;you have borne an honourable
      testimony to my excellent friend and countryman, Mr. Crotty, as a person
      of lively imagination, and a stout soldier besides. I beg to complete the
      merited eulogium, by assuring you that Peter is a good catholic into the
      bargain. Captain Fenwick noticed his conduct during the assault&mdash;and
      I accidentally witnessed his Christian temperament, immediately before the
      division moved into the trenches on that glorious and bloody evening. With
      three others, Peter and I held a ruinous apartment of an old farm-house in
      joint tenancy, and my corner was divided from the rest, by a blanket
      suspended from a line. When the division was under arms, I discovered that
      I had left some instruments behind which might possibly be required,
      returned consequently, to the house, and while hunting for them behind the
      blanket, I heard Peter Crotty open the outer door and come in. He, too,
      was in search of something he had forgotten&mdash;and in a false assurance
      that he was perfectly alone, he commenced &lsquo;thinking aloud,&rsquo; and I kept
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Holy Mary!&rsquo; he ejaculated, &lsquo;you have the best interest in heaven, and
      that every body knows. If I had as good at the Horse Guards, I would be a
      colonel in a fortnight. Oh, bad luck attend ye, Tim Doyle&rsquo;&mdash;and he
      kept rummaging through an old bullock-trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no finding anything after ye, you drunken sweep! Well, blessed
      Virgin, this is likely to be a bloody night; and the Lord, of course, will
      take his dealing trick out of the regiment,&mdash;glory to him&mdash;nobody
      can complain of it. But, sweet Lady&mdash;all I wish is, that it won&rsquo;t be
      as it was at Badajoz, in funeral order, but just let him take them fairly
      as they stand. There&rsquo;s three field-officers with the regiment, and we can
      easily spare one of them;&mdash;a couple of captains, ye know, would never
      be missed out of the number&mdash;and as to the subalterns, why let him
      have his own way about them. Oh, murder! there go the taps. If I live to
      come back, Tim Doyle, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your jacket for a new thirteen.&rsquo; *
      Again the drum ruffled&mdash;Peter shut down the trunk-lid, slammed the
      door after him, and hurried off to join his company&mdash;making his final
      exit in muttering a prayer to the Virgin, and an imprecation upon Tim
      Doyle.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Early next morning. I was agreeably surprised at receiving an order from
      Lord Wellington to attend him that afternoon. I rode over accordingly; and
      once more found myself in the presence of him who had been destined to
      restore the tarnished glory of the British arms, and after a brilliant
      career of conquest, terminate a doubtful struggle by a crowning victory. I
      found him immured in business&mdash;and yet the details of his bureau
      seemed to go on as orderly and methodically as the arrangements of a
      merchant&rsquo;s counting-house. On seeing me, he beckoned me to come forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I have been able to meet your wishes, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take this note to General R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. As yours is only to be a
      short sojourn, he has kindly offered to make room for you on his staff. No
      thanks&mdash;and waving his hand, the interview ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted at my good fortune, I rode off to the head-quarters of the
      fourth division&mdash;presented my credentials&mdash;was introduced to one
      of the most gallant soldiers that ever commanded a brigade&mdash;and made
      the acquaintance of the best fellow upon earth&mdash;his aid-de-camp, Tom

      passed away since the spring of manhood saw me on the Agueda&mdash;and the
      sear of middle age finds me recalling the brief but brilliant
      reminiscences of that &ldquo;crowded hour of glorious strife&rdquo; which followed.
      Time has sprinkled my hair with &ldquo;wisdom&rsquo;s silver&rdquo;&mdash;the blood, which
      once the slightest impulse hurried from the heart, flows temperately&mdash;&ldquo;wild
      youth&rsquo;s past&rdquo;&mdash;and I now look back with painful pleasure to one brief
      era of a life, for which, could it be lived again, I would cheerfully
      forego years of calm and spiritless enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this an ungrateful declaration of thine, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran? With every
      human blessing that can render existence happy, hast thou not been
      munificently gifted? Thou hast never known the stringent pressure of
      necessity&mdash;thou hast not felt the withering agony of unrequited love&mdash;no
      false friend has abused thy confidence&mdash;no lovely woman &ldquo;stooped to
      folly,&rdquo; and made thee blush for her inconstancy. Hast thou not a home?&mdash;the
      pledge of holy love has lisped upon thy knee&mdash;the smiles of beauty
      which never beamed upon another, have brightened at thy presence. What
      wouldst thou more? Upon my conscience, Mr. Hector O&rsquo;Halloran, thou art a
      most unreasonable Irish gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, that I looked^ back upon this epoch of my life with &ldquo;painful
      pleasure.&rdquo;&mdash;Well, that association of opposites he who has passed the
      meridian of existence can easily understand; for in the story of a life,
      pain and pleasure are generally found close companions. The pulse quickens
      when Vittoria, Sanroren, and San Sebastian pass in &ldquo;shadowy review&rdquo;&mdash;but
      the heart sickens when I recall the memory of him, at whose side I
      witnessed the enthusiastic heroism of that noble brigade, to whom he so
      often pointed out the path to victory. In long and cherished remembrance
      will that honoured name be held. To a lion&rsquo;s heart he united a woman&rsquo;s
      gentleness&mdash;the soldier followed him through love&mdash;his rivals
      admired and praised him. Why did he not die in the blaze of battle, where
      the noblest soldiers upon earth contended for a doubtful victory?&mdash;Why
      did not his glorious spirit wing its flight &ldquo;from cumbring clay,&rdquo; in that
      wild mountain pass, in which it gained its immortally?&mdash;Why, on &ldquo;red
      Waterloo&rdquo; did he not find a lifting grave? Alas! it was otherwise
      appointed and one of the noblest soldiers whom Britain ever claimed,
      perished by an ignoble hand. *
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle of May found the allies, in perfect unity of purpose and
      admirable efficiency, ready to open the campaign, and orders had been
      already transmitted to General Murray and the Spanish commanders on the
      eastern coast, to commence initial operations. Gradually, and in a manner
      not to occasion alarm in the French cantonments; the allied divisions were
      concentrated and advanced, and the supporting Spanish corps were put in
      march to co-operate. Bad weather, heavy rains, and an accident to the
      pontoon-train, delayed the opening of the campaign. It was but for a few
      days. On the 16th, Graham threw his infantry and artillery across the
      Douero: Hill moved forward to Bejar; and on the 22d, Lord Wellington
      marched with his right wing towards the Tonnes; and the practicability of
      the noblest conception that ever a great military genius matured, was now
      to be proven. &ldquo;A grand design,&rdquo; and grandly it was executed! For high in
      heart and strong of hand, Wellington&rsquo;s veterans marched to the encounter;
      the glories of twelve victories played about their bayonets; and he, the
      leader, so proud and confident, that in passing the stream which marks the
      frontier of Spain, he rose in his stirrups, and waving his hand, cried out&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell,
      Portugal!&rdquo; **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was said&mdash;I know not with what accuracy&mdash;that Major-
     General Ross was shot by a sneaking scoundrel ambushed in a
     tree.

     ** Napier.
</pre>
    <p>
      To oppose the fiery movements of the allied general, the enemy should have
      been combined, and in readiness; but they were equally unprepared and
      unsuspicious that an advance would be attempted. Napoleon&rsquo;s orders to
      concentrate on the Tonnes, had been fatally neglected; and no preparation
      had yet commenced to evacuate the capital, if such a step should become
      necessary. Joseph was at issue with his generals; the latter on bad terms
      with each other; and, strange as it might appear, in a country laid open
      to unmerciful contributions, subordinate officers were acquiring wealth,
      while the king was without a guinea, and his major-general (Jourdan)
      actually subsisting upon credit. Every commander seemed to think and act
      for himself. Joseph issued orders, but none obeyed them&mdash;some general
      asserted that Lord Wellington would attempt to turn the French right;&mdash;others
      declaring that he would march direct on Madrid. One would have it that the
      north would be his field of operation,&mdash;another maintained that it
      would be the south, and in concert with Sir John Murray. All were
      referring to what might be the future, when the initial movements were
      already made; and Wellington was over the Esla, before, it was known in
      the enemies&rsquo; cantonments that a division had been even put in march!
    </p>
    <p>
      None, save a military reader, can estimate this wonderful and successful
      operation. A part of Sir Thomas Graham&rsquo;s corps traversed a distance of
      more than two hundred miles, its route running through the Tras as Montes,
      the wildest district imaginable. Over a rugged surface&mdash;hitherto
      unknown to any save the shepherd or muleteer&mdash;forty thousand men,
      with artillery, and all the equipages of war, were passed and placed in
      safety on the further banks of a river unopposed&mdash;not a French
      general believing that even a cloud was collected, when the tempest had
      already burst!
    </p>
    <p>
      Merely waiting one day at Toro, to unite his left with the Gallician army,
      and enable the rear of his own divisions to close up, the allied general
      pushed rapidly for the Carion, his own troops beautifully in hand, and
      either flank protected by Spanish regulars and partidas. Too late, Joseph
      Buonaparte felt the danger of his position;&mdash;when the danger was
      discovered, it was irremediable; for with the certain stride of victory
      Wellington marched forward. The Pisuerga and the Arlanzan were passed, to
      use the language of an historian, &ldquo;easily as if they contained no water&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Burgos, that once had foiled his efforts, perished by the same hands which
      formerly had held it so successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far Lord Wellington&rsquo;s rapid advance had been attended with splendid
      success; but bolder operations, and followed by more brilliant results,
      remained behind. On the 13th, masked by his own cavalry, and a swarm of
      Spanish partidas, he suddenly marched by his left, to turn the sources of
      the Ebro, place his army between that river and the Reynosa mountains, and
      cut the enemy from the sea. It was a bold and judicious, but difficult and
      precarious, attempt; and one from which a nervous commander would have
      recoiled. The line of march ran through a mountain country, whose features
      were singularly rugged. The valleys were deep; gullies and ravines
      constantly presented themselves; and the roads, narrow and broken, were
      unsuited for the transport of field equipage and artillery. Still Lord
      Wellington persevered; and, nobly seconded by his gallant followers, every
      obstacle was overcome. When the ordinary means of moving forward the
      artillery were found impracticable, the guns were dismounted, and lowered
      or swayed over precipices which threatened to bar their farther progress.
      On went the Anglo-Portuguese divisions, in ceaseless march; and, after six
      days of incessant exertion, the allied columns issued from their mountain
      routes, and entered the deep valley of Vittoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet I had never been fairly under fire; our march from the Esla to the
      Zadora had been one of manouvre, Lord Wellington turning every position
      with admirable skill; and the slight collisions which occasionally
      resulted, occurring always between the light troops. One irregular but
      dashing affair, on the preceding day, had taken place unexpectedly,
      between a part of the light division and Maranzin&rsquo;s brigade, at the
      entrance of the valley of the Boveda, in which the French were severely
      handled, and narrowly escaped with the loss of their baggage, and five
      hundred men.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Espigo, after a very long march, late in the evening of the
      18th; and early next morning, moved on to Bayas, in the hope of forcing
      that pass, and cutting off the armies of the south, and centre. But Beille
      had taken a strong position, with the army of Portugal, to cover their
      passage through the defile of La Puebla. We were directed to attack in
      front, while the light division turned their position. A brief affair
      ensued, during which the armies of the south and centre threaded the
      defile, and came into line behind the Zadora. That object gained, Reille
      fell back, and crossed the river, and we bivouacked for that night upon
      the Bayas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was apparent to all that a great and decisive battle was at hand; King
      Joseph, with his immense pares and ambulances, was still in front of
      Vittoria; and although two huge convoys were ready for France, and one had
      been already despatched, still the quantity of baggage that remained was
      enormous, and the number of carriages almost incredible. The whole of his
      miserable Court had followed the steps of the royal fugitive. Traitors to
      their country, they had no mercy to expect; and in flight alone, was
      safety. The immense quantity of military stores&mdash;the accumulated mass
      of private plunder, collected for years before, and now heaped together in
      the confusion of a hurried retreat&mdash;the encumbrance of a numerous
      body of nobles and civilians,&mdash;all these tended to render Joseph&rsquo;s
      position the more embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he retreated without a battle, all must be lost. He vacillated&mdash;valuable
      time slipped away&mdash;and at last he determined to &ldquo;stand the hazard of
      the die;&rdquo; and accordingly, took a position in front of Vittoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 20th, we received intelligence that the French were
      resolved to accept battle the next day; and it was ascertained that they
      were busily engaged in fortifying the ground that Marshal Jourdan had
      selected. I was now on the eve of my first field; and a feeling of anxiety
      and restlessness kept me waking, while two or three veterans, who were
      huddled into the same tent, slept so soundly that I envied them. At
      day-break the camp was in a bustle. The third, fourth, seventh, and light
      divisions, which formed the infantry of the centre, got speedily under
      arms; and, accompanied by a powerful artillery, and the whole of the heavy
      cavalry, we crossed the ridges behind which we had pitched our tents, and
      over a rugged and difficult surface, moved stoutly and steadily towards
      the points marked for our separate attacks. We took a position in front of
      the bridge of Nanclares, covered from the enemy&rsquo;s fire by broken ground
      and underwood, and there awaited the movements of the third and seventh
      divisions, whom rougher ground and a greater distance had hitherto
      prevented from getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock the action began, by General Hill seizing the village of
      Puebla, and Morillo attacking the heights that domineered it. A doubtful
      and protracted struggle for the possession of the latter ensued. The
      French supported Maranzin, who held it; and Sir Rowland detached Colonel
      Cadogan, with two battalions, to sustain the Spaniards. Fresh troops, from
      time to time, came into action. Villatte&rsquo;s division were drawn from the
      centre, to maintain the heights. Hill reinforced the assailants; the
      contest still was doubtful; but Sir Rowland ended it by crossing the
      Zadora, pushing through the defile of Puebla, and carrying the village of
      Subijana de Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours had passed; and amid the intervals of the fire at Subijana, a
      distant cannonade was faintly heard upon our left, and indicated that
      Graham was up, and coming into action. The light division had already
      crossed the bridge of Très Puentes; one brigade of the third had forced
      that of Mendoza, and another, with the seventh division, forded the river,
      and attacked the French right, in front of Margarita. We were desired now
      to advance; and, passing the bridge of Nan-clares, were followed by the
      heavy cavalry, who, forming on our right in squadrons, connected us with
      Sir Rowland&rsquo;s left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already, fearing that he should be turned on both flanks, Joseph had
      issued orders to retreat; and, covered by a cloud of skirmishers, and
      under a tremendous fire of fifty pieces of artillery, he retired his
      columns on Gomecha, where his reserve was posted. Now the battle was at
      his height; the third division carried the village of Arinez, the 52d
      stormed Margarita; and the 87th seized Hermandad. But the last struggle
      was yet to come. Reille still maintained himself on the Upper Zadora, and,
      with eighty pieces of artillery in full and rapid play, the wreck of the
      armies of the south and centre were enabled to fall back, and make their
      last stand, between the villages of Ali and Armantia.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the storm of artillery arrested the onward progress of the
      allies. The battle raged furiously; but the struggle was fated to be
      short. Cole ordered the fourth division to advance. On rushed its noble
      battalions, untamed by a terrible cannonade and a heavy and well-supported
      musketry. The heights on the left of those occupied by the French were
      carried, and the doubtful conflict ended in a total route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the day I had been busily employed. I occasionally carried
      orders; and the steadiness with which my noble horse faced fire, attested
      the value of the Empecinado&rsquo;s present. I had procured at Frenada a very
      respectable animal, on which to mount Mark Antony; and, to do him justice,
      the fosterer seemed to follow like a shadow where I went. Just as we
      crowned the height, General R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; who was leading
      the column, beckoned to me, and I was directly at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallop back. Tell &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to launch the
      cavalry boldly&mdash;see!&mdash; the French infantry are mobbed, and
      running!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had half wheeled round to convey the order, when, suddenly, my gallant
      charger gave a convulsive shudder, and sank under me. I sprang from the
      saddle before he had time to roll over, and called on the fosterer to
      dismount&mdash;made one step to take his horse, and execute the order,
      when a sharp stroke smote me on the head. All around became confused&mdash;memory
      fled&mdash;and for a time I recollected nothing but indistinctly.

      When I did recover, I found myself under a small knoll, which sheltered us
      from ranging shots: the fosterer on one side, a twentieth grenadier on the
      other; and my excellent and valued friend Peter Grotty, seated on a dead
      horse, <i>vis-à-vis</i>, and giving orders for my resuscitation.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o the buzz of
      voices round me I had been fully conscious for the last five minutes; but
      the first words I understood distinctly, was an earnest inquiry, on the
      part of Lieutenant Crotty, regarding the safety of what he termed &ldquo;the
      stolen horse;&rdquo; and great was his sorrow on learning that the charger was
      defunct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed Bridget!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what a pity! Worth two hundred, if he
      was worth a taaster. * Well&mdash;it only shows that old swin&rsquo;s true&mdash;What
      comes over the old lad&rsquo;s back, whisks away under his belly. But I would
      like to know what the divil killed the rider? I&rsquo;ve groped him all over,
      and sorra scratch I can find upon him but this clip upon the head, and
      many a worse I&rsquo;ve got often at a hurling match. As he&rsquo;s dead, however&mdash;&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not dead, Peter!&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, upon my sowl I&rsquo;m glad to hear it from such good authority!&rdquo;
       returned Mr. Crotty. &ldquo;Give him another taste out of the canteen! If
      there&rsquo;s life in a man, brandy&rsquo;s the thing to find it out. Here we are&mdash;safe
      and comfortable against every thing but shells;&mdash;I thought I heard
      the whiz of one of them a while ago&mdash;may the curse o&rsquo; God light upon
      their inventor! You must know 1 have a mortal dread of them&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
      tell ye why.&mdash;The day before Salamanca, when Marmont and my Lord were
      watching each other like two pickpockets, the column halted, to let the
      men cook dinner, if they had any to cook. Well&mdash;I had none,&mdash;so
      I set out on the ramble, to see if luck would stand my friend&mdash;and
      who should I find behind a big rock, and eating cold pork, but Pat
      Dogherty and Charley Blake, of the ould &ldquo;rough and readies,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      13th. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; says Charley, &ldquo;didye get ye&rsquo;r dinner yet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Divil a pick!&rdquo;
       says I; &ldquo;and, what&rsquo;s more, I wish somebody would tell me where it&rsquo;s to
      come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw a chair,&rdquo; says he, jokin&rsquo;, &ldquo;and take share of the pork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, niver say it again,&rdquo; says I, so down I pops upon the grass, and,
      feaks, made a beautiful dinner of it. Well&mdash;out came the canteens, in
      coorse; and we begins drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;when bang goes two or three guns from
      the hill opposite us, on which the French were marchin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; says Charley. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; says Pat Dogherty, &ldquo;only that
      thief Marmont is bent upon some roguery; and just wants, by kickin&rsquo; up a
      row, to draw off the old lad&rsquo;s attention&mdash;manin, ye see, Lord
      Wellington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God! we&rsquo;re as safe here as if we were in Kilmainham Gaol,&rdquo;
       says I, looking up at the rock that was between us and the French. &ldquo;If
      Marmont batters away till he rises the price of gunpowder, he&rsquo;ll do us no
      harm.&rdquo; Well, Pat Dogherty stepped round, to see what the firing was about&mdash;and
      Charley Blake had lifted the canteen:&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the pope!&rdquo; says he,
      taking a pull of the spirits; and giving the health of his reverence out
      o&rsquo; compliment to me, because he thought I was a Catholic. As he said the
      words, down drops an eight-inch shell between us. &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; says I,
      rowlin&rsquo; myself down the hill, like a butter-firkin. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; says
      Charley, who was always a stupid divil, and never could bear to be
      interrupted in his drink. Och! before I could make him sensible, bang went
      the shell! and when Pat and I got up, we found Charley as dead as a
      mackarel; and dinner, drink, and Pat Dogherty&rsquo;s new cloak-case, blown
      regularly to the divil! No wonder I hate the whiz of them&mdash;&mdash;
      &ldquo;Well, how do ye find yerself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;pretty well; but a confounded dizziness of the head annoys me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;take another drop. Look round, Mark&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the name
      ye answer to? Turn a man or two over, and you&rsquo;ll find a fresh canteen, for
      this one&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there was no great difficulty in obtaining a liberal supply; for
      the hollow that Peter Crotty had selected as uniting safety with comfort,
      was thickly studded with dead and dying men: and there was scarcely a
      corpse, particularly a Frenchman&rsquo;s, from which a canteen was not
      obtainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the roar of battle gradually subsided into a spattering
      fire of musketry, interspersed by the booming of heavy guns, as the horse
      artillery hung upon the French rear, and cannonaded the dense masses of
      broken soldiery who hurried off in the direction of Salvatierra. But,
      lightened of their anus, and covered by their cavalry who still showed a
      steady front, they reached Metaueo, closely followed; there night ended
      the pursuit, and the victors and the vanquished claimed that season for
      repose which previous fatigue had rendered so desirable to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no defeat on record, in which a beaten army lost so much and lost
      so little, contradictory as the statement may appear. The whole <i>materiel</i>
      of war, the entire park of artillery, with stores, ammunition, trophies,
      treasure, and the most enormous collection of plunder that ever an
      invading army attempted to carry from the country it had for years
      despoiled, fell into the hands of the victors, or rather into those of the
      degraded wretches who followed them,&mdash;while in men the French loss
      scarcely exceeded that of the conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we had been an hour on the field, we were picked up, stowed away in
      a French calech, from which a <i>danseuse</i> on King Joseph&rsquo;s
      establishment had been ejected&mdash;and carried through the wreck of the
      enemy&rsquo;s plunder and military stores, into a city it had only vacated at
      midday. Mr. Crotty&rsquo;s wound was not very important, as the ball had passed
      clean through the thigh, and the hemorrhage been stopped by a proper
      ligature. Mine was a more serious accident, and gave me considerable
      annoyance for several weeks after it occurred. It is true that I had much
      reason to be thankful, if I would only put faith in the report of my
      medical attendant; for he demonstrated, clear as an axiom, that had the
      ball struck me the eighteenth part of an inch in &ldquo;fuller front,&rdquo; it would
      have popped through the &ldquo;os frontis&rdquo; to a moral, and I should have been
      then &ldquo;past praying for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks elapsed&mdash;the painful effects occasioned by the contusion
      gradually subsided, and within a month I was perfectly convalescent. As to
      Peter Crotty, his disabled member was speedily restored&mdash;and, at the
      end of a fortnight, he could have danced the <i>pater-o-pee</i>. One thing
      occasioned some surprise. Lord &lsquo;Wellington, in the excitement of his
      victory, forgot to make personal inquiries after his old partner&rsquo;s state
      of health,&mdash;and although his hospitality embraced the <i>elite</i> of
      his prisoners, and even the captured ladies were guests at his table
      during his brief sojourn at Vittoria, by some unaccountable oversight, a
      cover for Peter Crotty was forgotten&mdash;and if an invitation had been
      sent him for a quiet rubber at head quarters, unfortunately, it never
      reached its destination. Crotty, however, ascribed this apparent
      forgetfulness to its true cause&mdash;a press of business&mdash;and on one
      occasion, when we nearly ran against his lordship in the street, Peter
      bolted round the corner, feeling, very properly, that greetings in the
      market-place consumed valuable time, and between old friends were quite
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subsequent operations after the victory of the 21st of June, though
      not very important in themselves, proved the forerunners of great events.
      Soult came from Germany, by Napoleon&rsquo;s order, to assume the chief command
      and rally the beaten armies. Joseph Buonaparte&rsquo;s royal puppetism ended,
      and he retired into France&mdash;and Wellington followed up his victory by
      advancing to the Pyrenees, blockading Pampeluna, and regularly investing
      San Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Vittoria the mixed character of which an army is composed, was
      strikingly exhibited. Never, in the history of modern warfare, did defeat
      tempt the cupidity of the soldier with more extensive or more valuable
      booty,&mdash;and, to use the words of the historian, &ldquo;the fighting troops
      marched upon gold and silver without stooping to pick it up.&rdquo; But to
      others, the display of wealth was too trying for their moral endurance to
      withstand&mdash;the onward step of victory was stayed for filthy plunder,
      and, to the eternal disgrace of the delinquents, it was known that some
      officers, forgetting caste and honour, shared in &ldquo;the disgraceful gain.&rdquo;
       The evil consequences were so mischievous, as in some degree to paralyse
      the subsequent operations, and rob Vittoria of what would have otherwise
      been its grand results. The soldiers, instead of preparing food, and
      resting themselves after the battle, dispersed in the night to plunder,
      and were so fatigued, that when the rain came on next day, they were
      incapable of marching, and the allied army had more stragglers than the
      beaten one. Eighteen days after the Victory, twelve thousand five hundred
      men, chiefly British, were absent, most of them marauding in the
      mountains. *

    <p>
      No wonder, then, that the promptest means were used to thin the hospitals
      of the sick and wounded, and forward the convalescent to their regiments.
      Peter Crotty had been declared &ldquo;ready for action and with some fifty
      privates and non-commissioned officers pronounced food for gunpowder&rdquo;
       again. I determined to keep him company,&mdash;and on the morning of the
      18th of July, we quitted Vittoria, a month after we had entered it, and
      took the route to rejoin the fourth division in the Pyrenees. We reached
      Leyra on the 22d, and then learned that San Sebastian had been
      sufficiently battered to warrant an assault&mdash;and, as it was generally
      believed, the attempt would be made next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a noble opening for young ambition. Within a sharp ride of a
      beleaguered city&mdash;and it, too, on the very point of being carried by
      assault! Why, my father was a very prophet&mdash;and the glorious
      contingency he had only regarded with the eye of hope, was absolutely
      thrown by fortune in my way. I was also a free agent&mdash;and while Peter
      Crotty, &ldquo;a man under authority,&rdquo; of necessity, headed towards the
      mountains with &ldquo;his charge of foot,&rdquo; I had only to turn to the sea&mdash;and
      if I pleased, gain laurels in the breach, or there get &ldquo;a quietus.&rdquo; I
      consulted the fosterer&mdash;and he at once declared that it would not
      only be shameful but sinful, to let slip an opportunity of the kind, &ldquo;for
      the Lord only knew when such luck would fall in our way again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Crotty was taken into the number of our counsellors&mdash;and he
      confirmed Mark Antony&rsquo;s reasoning to the very letter&mdash;accompanied by
      a long jeremiade at being prohibited by duty from engaging in an agreeable
      excursion. He, Peter, would never forget Badajoz&mdash;Lord! what fun
      there was after it&mdash;he did not particularise the fun that was <i>at</i>
      it, nor detail the pleasant accompaniments of men being blown up by the
      company. He, Peter, had been wounded, and resided afterwards at a widow&rsquo;s
      house&mdash;a friendlier little woman he never met with,&mdash;she was
      better to him than a bad step-mother&mdash;they went regularly to mass&mdash;and
      he, Peter, was happy as the day was long. Indeed, he had great doubts
      about the propriety of marrying her at once&mdash;but her husband, not
      having &ldquo;gone to glory,&rdquo; but to Mexico, although he had not written for six
      months, still the devil, meaning the husband aforesaid&mdash;might be
      alive after all.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! blessed Mary 1 what fun you&rsquo;ll have!&rdquo;
       concluded Peter. &ldquo;You may rob a church, murder a bishop, and bad luck to
      the inquiry, good nor bad, afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleasure thus unexpectedly presented, and accompanied with such brilliant
      advantages, was not to be declined; and as I had recovered my lost horse,
      and procured a stout mule for the fosterer, we took the road to glory&mdash;namely,
      the cross one running through Gozueta to San Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defeat at Vittoria rendered the maintenance of this ancient fortress
      an object of great importance to the French. Hitherto the place had been
      greatly neglected, and even a part of its artillery removed. Instant
      orders, however, were issued by Joseph Buonaparte to restore the works,
      replace the guns, and render it, as far as possible, defensible. A
      garrison under General Key was hastily thrown in&mdash;and that of
      Gueteria, after blowing up that place, reinforced it&mdash;stores and
      provisions were sent by sea from France&mdash;whither, also, an enormous
      influx of Spanish and French refugees, who had sought safety in the city,
      were directed to repair&mdash;and with a brave garrison&mdash;and better
      still&mdash;a determined governor, San Sebastian prepared, by a vigorous
      and, as it was expected, a successful defence, to emulate those of
      Rodrigo, Badajoz, and Burgos, which had conferred so much honour on their
      respective commandants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The investing army, amounting to about ten thousand men, was composed
      chiefly of the fifth division, and two Portuguese brigades,&mdash;General
      Graham commanded in chief&mdash;General Oswald <i>en second</i>&mdash;and
      Colonel Dickson directed the siege artillery, amounting to forty pieces of
      different descriptions, but all of heavy calibre.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the 10th, operations actively commenced. On the morning of
      the 17th, a strong outwork called San Bartolomeo, with the adjacent suburb
      of San Martin, were carried by assault&mdash;and on the 20th, the whole of
      the batteries commenced breaching at once, without having first ruined the
      defences&mdash;a departure from established practice which afterwards
      occasioned a galling failure, attended with a hewy loss of gallant men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of the 23d, when I and my foster brother topped a
      rising ground, which commanded a more immediate view of the beleaguered
      city, and the investing army which encompassed it. For fifteen miles the
      booming of hewy artillery gave us full assurance, that, if our intent was
      &ldquo;up to the breach!&rdquo; we were still in excellent time. The thunder of the
      British batteries seemed to redouble as we neared the fortress&mdash;and
      while the fire of the besieged was slack and feeble, compared with that of
      the assailants; the roar from the Chofre batteries was continuous&mdash;and
      the practice so beautiful and correct, that a new breach on the right of
      the main one, had been formed by that day&rsquo;s fire, and the wall for thirty
      yards exhibited a perfect ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sight which, suddenly presented to an eye inexperienced in the
      &ldquo;circumstance of war,&rdquo; would never fade from memory. The sun was nearly
      setting&mdash;but there was no lack of light to induce the besiegers to
      silence the fire of their guns. The mortar battery, erected the preceding
      day to destroy the defences, and ruin a stockade which insulated the high
      curtain on the land front, had set the houses in the immediate vicinity of
      the great breach in flames; and, as they spread rapidly, the safety of the
      town from that wild element appeared as much endangered, as from the
      impending outburst of human violence. Although in immediate expectation of
      the assault, this calamity did not abate the confidence of the gallant old
      man who commanded; but for a day, and under an erroneous belief that the
      burning houses would isolate the breach if carried, the fearful trial was
      postponed. All was ready to deliver the assault&mdash;the storming parties
      were in the trenches&mdash;but on the morning, the fire still raged with
      such unconquered violence, that it was dreaded it would prove as
      formidable to the assailants, as it had been found embarrassing to the
      assailed&mdash;and consequently the storm was delayed, a circumstance, it
      was said, that abated the ardour of the troops, and tended much to produce
      the unfortunate failure which occurred next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That awful pause&mdash;the day of the 24th, was not like the calm which
      precedes the tempest. The batteries on the Chofre sand-hills opened again,
      and a whirlwind of heavy shot enlarged the ruins at the breaches, and, as
      it was hoped, injured the defences materially. The fire of the garrison
      was nearly silenced&mdash;and while the means of aggression were evidently
      reduced, they laboured diligently to render those of resistance formidable
      and efficient. A cavalier that commanded the curtain was armed with field
      pieces&mdash;and every point, whether of the castle or the hill, which
      looked upon the breach or its approaches, was furnished with heavier
      artillery. The <i>fausse brave</i> beneath which the storming parties must
      advance, was lined with shells and other destructive missiles, to be
      rolled down upon the assailants as they advanced along its base&mdash;while
      every house within musket range was loop-holed, and the breach carefully
      retrenched; but even had it been crowned successfully, still a sheer
      descent of fifteen feet remained before the assailants could reach a
      street composed entirely of burning houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In war, there are wonderful accidents which lead frequently to failure or
      defeat&mdash;and from fortuitous circumstances, great results arise. In
      carrying a parallel across the Isthmus to reach the land defences, the
      working party broke through the water-course of a ruined aqueduct. An
      engineer boldly crept into the dark and narrow drain&mdash;explored it
      carefully&mdash;and at the end of two hundred and thirty yards, found
      himself separated from the counterscarp only by a door, and directly in
      face of the right demi-bastion of the horn-work. Here fortune had
      befriended the besiegers, and supplied them with an admirable mine. The
      engineers formed a globe of compression at the extremity, and loaded it
      with an enormous charge of powder&mdash;and though this dangerous
      operation was effected under the feet of the French sentries, none took
      alarm, and the work was silently and effectually completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of attack was to assault the greater and lesser breaches
      together, when the spring of the mine, formed in the head of the aqueduct,
      should give the signal. It was expected that the explosion there would
      fill the ditch of the horn-work with rubbish&mdash;and in the confusion
      and surprise, the Portuguese might possibly escalade at that point, and
      effect a lodgement in the place. The Royals were directed against the
      great breach, supported by the ninth regiment&mdash;and the thirty-eighth
      were ordered to carry the smaller one. An <i>elite</i> detachment, formed
      of the three light companies of these regiments, attended by an engineer
      and ladder party, were designed to have escaladed the high curtain, while
      the breaches were assaulted, and clear the enemy from it with the bayonet;
      and to this party, Mark Antony and I attached ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after midnight, the storming parties with the columns of attack
      entered the trenches&mdash;and within three hundred yards of the breaches,
      waited impatiently for sun-rise, when it had been arranged that the
      assault was to be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no use in concealing it&mdash;that interval of two hours was the
      most anxious passage of my history. I felt that, as it on the hazard of a
      die, life or death depended. Darkness and silence prevailed&mdash;the
      latter only broken by the thunder of the breaching batteries, which were
      kept in full play upon the breaches and defences. Many an anxious inquiry
      was made to know &ldquo;how time went,&rdquo;&mdash;many an eager look was cast
      eastward to watch for early dawn&mdash;but hundreds were fated never to
      witness the rising of another sun. While it was still dark, the globe of
      compression formed in the head of the aqueduct was fired. The storming
      parties rushed forward from the trenches&mdash;and the work of death
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explosion of the mine was unfortunately not heard at the Chofre
      batteries, and the guns, instead of ceasing, continued in full play upon
      the place. Hence, the assailants as they advanced, were scourged by a
      double fire, and suffered more from the grape of their own batteries than
      the enemy&rsquo;s cannonade. The narrow slip of ground by which the stormers
      approached the breaches, contracted between the river on one side, and the
      retaining wall of the horn-work on the other, was embarrassed with rocks
      and pools of water, and consequently, the movement of the column became
      disorderly. Under a withering fire, the breach was gained&mdash;up flew
      the leading officers&mdash;a few gallant soldiers followed&mdash;but the
      supports moved slowly&mdash;the troops came straggling to the breach&mdash;and
      instead of mounting to the assistance of the gallant few who had already
      crowned the ruins, the greater portion of the assailants stopped at the
      bottom, and interchanged musketry with the French who lined the ramparts,
      and kept up a deadly fusilade on the disordered mass below. The towers of
      Los Hornos and Mesquitas opened a hewy flanking fire; and from the St.
      Elmo and the Mirador, grape fell in torrents upon the broken column&mdash;the
      Castle threw shells with great precision&mdash;grenades were flung from
      the ramparts&mdash;a stream of fire issued from the loop-holed houses&mdash;while
      flames raging behind the breach, seemed to forbid approach, even had
      offensive means been unemployed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still though the men fell by fifties, their officers endeavoured to rally
      them and crown the breach anew; but every moment the chances of success
      became more desperate. The regiments got intermixed, and that terrible
      confusion of troops mobbed in a narrow space between the breach and the
      Urumea, became irretrievable. At that moment the remnant of our light
      companies pushed through the disordered column, and Campbell, its
      chivalrous leader, followed by a daring few, gained the summit. Mid-way
      up, my foster-brother fell&mdash;while I, with a dozen or two, a second
      time reached the rampart. We held it but a moment. Under the storm of
      musketry all went down; and there were but two or three standing, when a
      bullet stretched me beside those with whom &ldquo;life had ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the final effort; the remnant of the assailants hurried off, the
      regiments mobbed together, to seek shelter in the trenches; marking,
      unhappily and too plainly, the lines of the advance and retreat with the
      bodies of the dead and dying. The French fire ceased; and although the
      British batteries opened with redoubled violence on the enemy&rsquo;s defences
      to cover the retirement of the shattered columns, several of the gallant
      defenders of the breach braved the storm, to remove the wounded within the
      town, and save them from the indiscriminating destruction which the
      British artillery poured alike on friend and foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute I was unconscious of what was passing; and when memory
      returned, I was in the act of being turned over by a French soldier, who
      found, that from hwing fallen on my face, my present position was not
      exactly favourable for his intended operations. I looked wildly round;
      several men in blue uniforms were examining the fallen soldiers, who lay
      thickly on the summit of the breach as lewes in autumn. Different objects
      influenced the examination: some were seeking plunder&mdash;others, on a
      nobler errand, were separating the wounded from the dead, to remove the
      former out of fire, and obtain for them surgical assistance. As the
      grenadier rolled me over, an officer stepped forward and inquired if I
      were &ldquo;living or dead?&rdquo; The voice was perfectly familiar; with my cuff I
      wiped away the blood, which, trickling from my forehead, had partially
      prevented me from looking at the speaker before. &ldquo;Is that Cammaran?&rdquo; I
      muttered, as I caught a glance of his well-remembered features.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;my name! Sacre!&mdash;who have we
      here? Baise his head, Antoine. By heaven!&mdash;the very man on earth I
      would shed my heart&rsquo;s blood to save!&rdquo; Next moment he was kneeling at my
      side&mdash;and held me gently in his arms, until I was lifted by four
      soldiers from the ground, and removed carefully from the breach and out of
      the range of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you much hurt, my friend?&rdquo; inquired the gallant Frenchman. &ldquo;And where
      is your companion, my brave deliverer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I fear that he is lost to me. He fell half way up the
      breach&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ere my reply was given, Cammaran, after directing the party to bear me to
      a neighbouring church which the French had converted into an hospital,
      rushed to the breach again. Calling on a soldier to follow, he descended
      the ruins of the broken wall, and, among a heap of dead and dying,
      commenced looking for the object of his search. It was a daring, an almost
      desperate attempt; for, irritated at the failure of the storming parties,
      every gun in battery was madly turned against the breach and curtain, and
      showers of round and grape-shot splintered against the unbroken masonry,
      or knocked the rubbish wildly about, occasioning double danger to all
      within its reach. Undismayed, the gallant Frenchman persevered; and to his
      unfeigned delight, in a man who had raised himself upon one elbow and was
      gazing despondingly around, he recognised the person he risked so much
      danger to discover&mdash;his former camarado&mdash;the fosterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of the grenadier who accompanied him, Mark Antony was
      carried safely from the breach; and in a few minutes after my wounds had
      been carefully dressed, I had the happiness to find my foster brother
      placed on a mattress beside my own, and hear the French surgeon, on a
      hasty examination, announce to Captain Cammaran the gratifying
      intelligence, that Mark Antony was &ldquo;not past praying for&rdquo; yet, but, with
      moderate good luck, might still survive, to do &ldquo;the state some service,&rdquo;
       and figure in another breach.

      the stained windows of the church; and the cannonade, so fierce and
      incessant when I was being carried from the breach, died suddenly away and
      not a gun was heard. I inquired what might have caused this extraordinary
      silence, and learned from an hospital-assistant that an hour&rsquo;s truce had
      been agreed on between the besiegers and besieged, to permit the wounded
      to be succoured, and allow helpless wretches who would otherwise have been
      drowned by the rising of the Urumea, to be carried beyond the influence of
      the tide, and taken either to the trenches or the town. On this work of
      mercy Cammaran was absent; and, as Mark Antony and myself were
      sufficiently recovered to converse, we began to make mutual inquiries
      touching our present position and future prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my conscience,&rdquo; observed the fosterer, &ldquo;now that we have made the
      experiment, I can&rsquo;t say that I can either discover the advantages your
      honoured father held out by letter, or the fun Mr. Crotty described by
      &lsquo;word of mouth,&rsquo; as attendin&rsquo; these same sieges and assaults. To my mind
      Vittoria was the thing;&mdash;beautiful day-light;&mdash;your enemy
      decently before ye&mdash;if a man dropped, his comrades stepped over him
      as if they were treading upon eggs, and he was removed to the rear with
      every civility, to find a full flask on every body he turned over, if he
      only had the luck to be settled in a decent neighbourhood. Here&mdash;if
      this be fun, may the Lord deliver us from such fun in future! We are stuck
      down for two hours shivering in a ditch. Whiz! goes a mine&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      our mine, and the signal,&rsquo; says one engineer&mdash;&lsquo;The divil welcome the
      news!&rsquo; says a second&mdash;and off we go blundering in the dark, the Lord
      knows where. Before we&rsquo;re well in motion, bang goes another explosion!
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the enemy&rsquo;s says another&mdash;and not a doubt about that, for up
      go the forlorn hope, body and bones. &lsquo;Push on, lads,&rsquo; cry the officers;&mdash;one
      falls over a d&mdash;&mdash;-d rock, another souses into a pool of water;
      on one side the French are firing like the divil&mdash;on the other, and I
      suppose, out of personal respect, our own batteries consider it a
      compliment to knock us over by the dozen. Well, we top the breach at last&mdash;and
      a beautiful prospect it is!&mdash;In front, a jump of twenty feet into a
      blazing house, or you&rsquo;r shot down right and left, like crows in a
      wheatfield. &ldquo;Arrah!&rdquo; said Mark Antony, &ldquo;if your father wrote every day in
      the week, not forgettin&rsquo; Sunday, the divil a such a night of pleasure will
      I put in if I can help it. But, Mister Hector, what do ye suppose they&rsquo;ll
      do with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, possibly, keep us here for half our lives, and send us into France
      to put in the remainder of them pleasantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then, if they do,&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;they&rsquo;r cuter * than they
      think. By all that&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; and Mark flourished his sounder arm over
      the blanket,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Anglice,&mdash;more cunning.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so soon,&rdquo; said a voice&mdash;laughingly; and Cammaran stepped
      from behind a wooden screen which had hidden him while approaching. At the
      same moment a salvo of artillery thundered from the Chofre battery&mdash;the
      guns of San Sebastian replied. The truce had expired&mdash;and the game of
      death had recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So end civilities,&rdquo; said the Frenchman; &ldquo;still it is comfortable to know,
      that the calls of humanity have been attended to. I have applied for what
      you call in England &lsquo;a billet&rsquo;&mdash;that is, the commandant&rsquo;s permission
      to reside during your convalesence in a private house, instead of being
      exposed, as you would be otherwise, to the inconvenience of a crowded
      hospital. For this indulgence I have given my <i>parole</i>, and that
      leaves you at liberty to visit any part of the city within the <i>enceinte</i>
      of the place when you are able to walk abroad. I know that my good friend
      here, even if leg and arm were not <i>hors de combat</i> as they are,
      would scarcely run away, when that act would compromise my honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;by this book;&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer, raising himself upon his
      elbow&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re fairly ruined, Hector <i>avourneeine!</i> Here we&rsquo;re
      regularly on the langle. Arrah&mdash;Mister Cammaran, dear, I know ye
      meant it for the best&mdash;but, why the divil did ye make a bargain of
      the kind? De ye think ye could get dacently out of it? Och&mdash;if we
      were only back in the country we were in, when we first became acquainted
      with that Empecinado, as they call him&mdash;it was no sayin&rsquo; what luck
      might turn up still. This moment, going to be hanged&mdash;the next,
      drinking as if ye were at a priest&rsquo;s funeral. &lsquo;Turn him out to be shot,&rsquo; 
      was the order one minute&mdash;while, &lsquo;turn him for brandy and water,&rsquo; was
      the next. One minute you wern&rsquo;t master of a <i>scultogue</i>&mdash;the
      next ye were riding in the saddle of a French marshal. Of all the inns I
      ever stopped at, I never met any where they pay scores as they do in
      Spain. You go to bed in peace and quietness, and you&rsquo;re bundled out before
      you&rsquo;re well asleep, to be told, that you must light your way through a
      yard-full of hussars, and swim a river afterwards that would give a
      water-dog rheumatism for life. You stop at the next public house, and
      receive all manner of civility. Of course, you&rsquo;re expected to pay up. Not
      at all: one black look from an ill-visaged gentleman who accompanies you;
      and the account is rubbed off the slate in a jiffy. Excepting there was
      over much shooting and hanging&mdash;a pleasanter excursion I never would
      desire&mdash;but, may the Lord forgive us! we were not sufficiently
      thankful at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;my dear friend,&rdquo; said Captain Cammaran, with a smile. &ldquo;My
      engagement is only binding while you are invalided. When perfectly
      recovered, my parole is easily recalled&mdash;and I have no doubt you will
      be very comfortable in La Mota. Plenty of fresh air&mdash;and free liberty
      to seek any corner you may fancy, as the least unlikely for a shell to
      drop upon. In the mean time, I recommend you to accept the billet I have
      obtained&mdash;and by the way, in the house of a Spaniard in worse odour
      with the old commandant than Don Francisco La Pablos, you could hardly
      have been established. But I have already ordered apartments to be
      prepared, and will see that every attention shall be paid to you. This
      place will be presently intolerable, and the sooner you remove to your new
      quarters all the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last remark was unhappily correct. The church filled rapidly with the
      wounded. Every minute fresh sufferers were brought in&mdash;and the scene
      of butchery&mdash;merciful and necessary&mdash;which commenced, was to us,
      particularly disgusting. It was wonderful how differently men submitted to
      sad alternatives,&mdash;death or amputation. One, an officer of faultless
      symmetry, sternly rejected the advice of his kind attendants. &ldquo;Nothing but
      the removal of the fractured limb can save you&mdash;you will die,
      otherwise,&rdquo; said the French surgeon. &ldquo;Well&mdash;be it so,&rdquo; returned the
      sufferer calmly, &ldquo;death is preferable to deformity. Lose no time with me&mdash;you
      may be serviceable to my poor comrade.&rdquo; Immediately beside him, a young
      lad was stretched&mdash;I should say he was not nineteen&mdash;-a fine,
      florid, healthy looking Englishman. His wound had been a severe contusion&mdash;and
      a passing observation of the French surgeons, announced that his was a
      hopeless case. And yet, death visited him in mercy. He appeared to undergo
      no pain&mdash;and in fancy, conversed with a &ldquo;darling mother&rdquo; and his
      &ldquo;little sister,&rdquo; as he termed them&mdash;babbled about green fields and
      expired with a smile upon his lips, under the firm belief that he had
      returned to the home he loved, and was re-united to those dear objects
      whom he idolized.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never felt myself more relieved, than when a French fatigue-party came,
      to remove, me on a stretcher. Weak from loss of blood&mdash;dispirited at
      the painful recollection that I was now about to undergo imprisonment, to
      whose duration none could name the limit&mdash;every thing around was
      calculated to increase those feelings of despondency. The gloomy building
      seemed desecrated by the purposes it had been turned to&mdash;and where
      the faithful had worshipped, the penitent had told the tale of sin and
      shame, and been forgiven&mdash;where love had been hallowed by holy rite,
      and supplications for the soul&rsquo;s weal of the departed had arisen&mdash;in
      that the temple of peace, war&rsquo;s horrid consequences were exhibited&mdash;and,
      in all the terrible variety which attends on death by violence, many a
      spirit was escaping from its mortal coil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house where I was about to take up my residence was situated close to
      the harbour, and, being at a distance from the breaches, was consequently,
      out of the fire of the besiegers. As we passed through the streets, I
      could not but remark the melancholy and deserted appearance that all
      around presented. The shops were unopened&mdash;the private dwellings
      jealously closed up&mdash;and the terrified inhabitants seemed not yet
      satisfied that the assault had failed, and danger was over for the
      present. When we reached the domicile of La Pablos, we found that our
      arrival had been duly announced. We were admitted into a narrow court-yard&mdash;and
      at the door of his mansion, the owner was waiting to receive us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of my future host was not particularly prepossessing.
      Although stricken in years, his carriage was lofty and unbroken&mdash;and
      the expression of his countenance seemed that of a proud and daring
      spirit, obliged to bend for a time to circumstances, and stoop to a
      thraldom from which it secretly recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniard showed the way in&mdash;and I was placed on a comfortable
      bed, in an apartment very clean, but very plainly furnished. At the
      opposite side of the hall, a room had been provided for Mark Antony&mdash;for
      whose transit to these his new quarters, after I had been safely
      deposited, the stretcher and fatigue party were despatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you some linen&mdash;and that is more than many of our people
      could afford. In turn of duty, the escort of the convoy which marched for
      France on the 19th fell to my lot&mdash;and bitterly I lamented that I was
      not fated to witness the defeat, which we all considered as so certainly
      attendant on Lord Wellington&rsquo;s advance upon Vittoria. The thing seems
      incomprehensible&mdash;and even yet we regard the king&rsquo;s disaster almost
      as a dream. Well&mdash;let it pass&mdash;<i>c&rsquo;est fortune de guerre</i>.
      The Emperor&rsquo;s lieutenant is in the Pyrenees&mdash;and now, my Lord
      Wellington, look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might not that cautionary hint, my dear Cammaran, be equally serviceable
      to your friend, the Duke of Dalmatia?&rdquo; I replied, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no. From secret intelligence which has reached the fortress, a
      very few days will end your leader&rsquo;s visionary prospects. What! enter
      France&mdash;carry the war over the frontier, and pollute the sacred soil!
      The thunderbolt is charged&mdash;and the hand is already present that will
      hurl it. But I must go. Duty will engage me the whole day, but in the
      evening I will visit you.&rdquo;&mdash;Then turning to our host, Cammaran
      commended me and my companion to his especial attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let nothing in this case be wanted, Senhor&mdash;you stand already not
      very favourably with the Governor. Adieu, for a time, my friend&rdquo;&mdash;and
      pressing my hand, the Frenchman took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw a countenance on which scorn, hatred, and revenge, seemed
      struggling for mastery, until I noticed that of Don Francisco. When the
      door of the court-yard closed, he poured forth a torrent of anathemas&mdash;then
      turning to me, his features instantly relaxed&mdash;and approaching my
      couch he took my hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger, you are welcome. The name of Englishman I respect&mdash;and the
      Spaniard is an ingrate who does not. If my manner in receiving you was not
      as warm as it might have been, ascribe it to the true cause&mdash;the
      pestilential presence of yonder foreigner. The sight of these insolent
      oppressors turns my blood to gall&mdash;their very language is discord to
      my ears&mdash;I hate them with all a Spaniard&rsquo;s hatred. But why display
      impotent rage in words?&mdash;&lsquo;Tis womanly&mdash;yet still, while the hand
      dares not strike a blow, the tongue finds some relief in venting the
      feelings of a surcharged breast&mdash;a maddened brain&mdash;in curses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at La Pablos. His features were convulsed with passion. I had
      heard that many severities had been exercised by the French during the
      Peninsular conflict&mdash;and I concluded that Don Francisco had been one
      of the unhappy Spaniards who had suffered from the oppression of the
      invaders. The arrival of the fosterer, for that time, ended our
      conversation&mdash;the host quitting me to attend to this his second
      guest, and minister to the wants of Mark Antony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days passed away&mdash;I had sufficiently recovered to be enabled to
      leave my room; and, leaning on the arm of a French soldier, who was daily
      in attendance on me by a special order from the Governor, I walked for a
      short distance every morning on the ramparts which overlooked the bay. My
      wound, though severe at the time that I received it, was one that healed
      rapidly&mdash;the bullet having slanted from the rib it struck against,
      and instead of taking what would have been otherwise a mortal direction,
      it inflicted a painful, but fortunately what proved a superficial injury,
      The fosterer was also convalescent&mdash;the ball had passed through his
      thigh without injuring the bone in its transit&mdash;his arm healed
      rapidly&mdash;and in a few days more the learned leach who attended us,
      announced that Mark Antony would be, as the fosterer termed it himself,
      &ldquo;right upon his pins again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far we had reason for self-gratulation&mdash;and as far as kindness
      from the host, and constant attentions on the part of Cammaran would go,
      we had no reason to complain of our captivity. But other circumstances
      allayed the satisfaction we should otherwise have felt&mdash;for every day
      the prospect of deliverance became more distant, and matters assumed a
      gloomier aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Wellington, on hearing of the miscarriage at San Sebastian, came down
      from the covering army to ascertain the causes of the failure, and, as it
      was reported, to adopt immediate means to remedy the disaster, and make
      himself master of the place. But, alas! our hopes that the speedy capture
      of the city would restore us to liberty again, ended on the morning of the
      27th. Overnight, the batteries had been disarmed and the guns removed to
      Passages&mdash;the siege was turned into a blockade&mdash;and taking
      advantage of the confusion, the garrison sallied from the horn-work,
      surprised the soldiers in the trenches, and carried back more than two
      hundred prisoners. Rumour also was busy on the wing. It was said that
      Soult had already taken the offensive&mdash;that the allied forces in
      advance, had been attacked, defeated, and driven back&mdash;and an order,
      directing Sir Thomas Graham to march on the Bidassoa with all his
      disposable troops, confirmed the unwelcome news.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence that Napoleon&rsquo;s lieutenant had actually commenced
      operations to relieve Pampeluna and San Sebastian, and afterwards
      celebrate his maker&rsquo;s birth-day in Vittoria, was perfectly correct. On the
      same morning and hour, while we had made our sanguinary and unsuccessful
      attempt upon the fortress, Soult commenced his daring operations, by
      driving in the pickets and scaling the pass of Altobisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although desperately outnumbered, the allies held their mountain position
      most obstinately&mdash;and for hours the combat raged with unabated fury,
      among wild and Alpine heights five thousand feet above the level of the
      sea. This protracted defence allowed time for others of the allied
      brigades to come, while a dense fog prevented the French marshal from
      executing the general attack he intended to have made with overwhelming
      numbers. Cole held his position with comparatively little loss&mdash;and
      when night came, finding his right turned at Orbaiceta, he cleverly
      retreated during the darkness, carrying ten thousand men safely through
      mountain passes, which rendered a regressive movement in the face of
      thirty thousand French bayonets a delicate and dangerous attempt. The
      position of Roncesvalles was consequently abandoned&mdash;and the first
      great effort from which Soult had expected far different results, left him
      with the allied brigades still like lions in the passes, and seven leagues
      of Alpine country interposed between him and Pampeluna, the grand object
      of his operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 26th, the French marshal resumed the offensive. A
      day of occasional combats and severe marching, while the English generals
      slowly and steadily fell back, produced no greater results than those
      attendant upon yesterday. Night came&mdash;and Soult, with altered
      convictions as to the probability of eventual success, waited for morning
      to try his fortunes in the field anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third trial was certainly more propitious. The Aretesque and Maya
      passes were attacked in great force, and, aided by a partial surprise, the
      French were enabled to drive the pickets back upon their supports,&mdash;and
      eventually, but after the most desperate fighting, the allied position was
      won. Four Portuguese guns were captured&mdash;and the French, elevated by
      this success, pressed the reduced battalions, who still retired, but
      slowly and sullenly, blocking up each ridge or pass they defended with the
      bodies of the dead and dying. At six o&rsquo;clock, completely worn out with
      fatigue, their numbers reduced to a third, their ammunition almost
      expended, the rocky heights of Atchiola were about to be abandoned&mdash;but
      at the moment, a brigade of the seventh division came opportunely up&mdash;the
      battle was sternly renewed, and the French forced to retire from the
      disputed mountain, and occupy the pass of Maya which they had won so
      dearly. In these sanguinary and protracted combats, Soult, with an
      expenditure of fifteen hundred men, gained a few miles of mountain and
      four disabled guns&mdash;a miserable trophy for such a waste of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could surpass the triumph of the garrison when the intelligence of
      the marshal&rsquo;s advance was confirmed&mdash;and the affairs of these three
      days mountain warfare were grossly mistated. Roncesvalles and Linzoain
      were described as brilliant actions&mdash;glorious to the arms of France;
      while Maya was exaggerated into a crowning victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hours of Soult&rsquo;s temporary success were numbered. On his return
      from San Sebastian, Wellington heard of the French attack on the evening
      of the 27th, and hurrying forward to San Estevan, which he reached the
      morning of the 28th&mdash;there ascertained the true position of affairs.
      His plans were formed with his accustomed rapidity and decision&mdash;and
      he determined to concentrate in front of Pampeluna, and retreat by the
      valley of the Lanz.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the fortress profiting by the cessation of the
      investment, received ample supplies of stores and ammunition by sea from
      France, and in return transmitted back the sick and wounded, thus getting
      relieved of the most troublesome incumbrance with which a beleaguered city
      is incommoded. New defences were planned and executed&mdash;former damages
      repaired&mdash;the works were generally strengthened&mdash;the magazines
      stored with powder and provisions&mdash;and San Sebastian was, in this
      interval, rendered stronger than when the besiegers first broke ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these events to me held out a melancholy prospect. It was already
      intimated that on the first favourable opportunity the prisoners would be
      forwarded to France&mdash;and in that case, captivity and the war would be
      coeval. A yearning after home momentarily increased. Isidora was ever
      present&mdash;and I cursed the hour that, for the bauble, fame, I had
      quitted the land of liberty and love. Mark Antony bore thraldom even more
      impatiently than I. He cursed France, Spain, and Portugal in a breath&mdash;read
      a letter from the rat-catcher once a day&mdash;and another, I fancy from
      the lady of his love, &ldquo;every minute i&rsquo; th&rsquo; hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are we to do, Mark?&rdquo; I inquired, after we had groaned in
      unison until both were weary of complaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer, &ldquo;Give the thieves leg-bail, and &lsquo;cut our
      lucky&rsquo; the first opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was wisdom in Mark Antony&rsquo;s advice, and I determined to follow it.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he exultation of
      the French garrison at the reported victories which had crowned the
      efforts of Soult for the relief of Pampeluna was but a short-lived triumph&mdash;for
      an attempt vauntingly commenced, and certainly very gallantly carried out,
      had been signally defeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picton, followed closely by Soult, had retreated through the valley of the
      Zuberi before day-break. On nearing Pampeluna, the English general found
      that the fourth division had already passed Villalba; the garrison of
      Pampeluna had sallied and spiked a battery&mdash;the blockading Spaniards
      were in terrible confusion&mdash;and every thing bore the appearance of
      disaster. With a stern hardihood, which formed the best point in Picton&rsquo;s
      military character, he determined at once to turn and offer battle to the
      pursuers&mdash;and accordingly, formed in battle order upon the ridges of
      Miguel, Escova, and Christoval; thus masking the fortress he came to
      relieve from Soult&rsquo;s view as he issued from the valley of the Zuberi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French marshal felt little doubt that the object of his previous
      efforts was now about to be realized. Within two leagues of Pampeluna he
      followed a retiring army, and in another hour would be in communication
      with that fortress. What, then, was his surprise, when on emerging from
      the valley, he found the third division and Morillo&rsquo;s Spaniards in
      position on the bold and rocky chain rising in front of Huarte, and Cole
      more immediately advanced, in possession of the heights near Zabaldica
      which command the Huarte road? Hastily he adopted and executed a bold
      movement to form a line of battle; but, while that was in progress,
      another and a greater actor appeared suddenly upon the stage; and when he
      came, the tide of Soult&rsquo;s fortune turned, and defeat followed in his
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting the Bastan on the 27th, Lord Wellington learned at Ostiz, that
      Picton had retired on Pampeluna, and, riding at speed to Sauroren, he
      perceived Clausel&rsquo;s divisions in full march, and with an eagle-glance
      discovered from the direction taken by the French columns, that the allied
      movement through the Lanz must certainly be intercepted. There was not a
      moment to be lost; an order was despatched that the troops should move
      bodily by the right towards Oricain, a village nearly in the rear of the
      mountain position taken up by Sir Lowry Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In issuing this hurried order, one of war&rsquo;s romantic incidents occurred.
      The despatch was written on the parapet of the bridge; and as the
      staff-officer who carried it, rode out of one extremity of the village,
      the French cavalry galloped in at the other; while the allied commander
      dashed quickly up the hill, and joined the allied troops who held it. His
      appearance was sudden, unexpected, and electrical. A Portuguese battalion
      raised an exulting cheer&mdash;the name of <i>Wellington!</i> passed from
      regiment to regiment, accompanied by a thundering huzza; while, by a
      strange coincidence, Soult was at the moment so immediately in front, that
      the rival commanders were pointed out distinctly to each other. The
      evening passed without any striking effort. Soult examined the allied
      position under the fire of his light troops&mdash;a thunder-storm ended
      the skirmish, and both sides determined on a trial of skill and strength
      to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 28th, a day ever memorable in peninsular history, found both sides
      prepared for action. Soult, intending to crush the left of the fourth
      division, and ignorant of the march of the sixth, made dispositions to
      enable him to attack Cole&rsquo;s left and front together, while Reille, at the
      same time, should carry the height held by the Spaniards and the British
      40th. The former effort turned out a fatal experiment; and the blow
      intended to crush the allied brigade before it could be assisted met with
      a tremendous counter-stroke. &ldquo;Striving to encompass the left of the
      allies, the French were themselves encompassed.&rdquo; Suddenly a Portuguese
      brigade appeared upon their right; the sixth division showed itself as
      unexpectedly in front; the fourth turned fiercely on their left; and,
      scourged at the same time by a front and flanking fire, the French columns
      were driven back, men falling fast on both sides; for the French fought
      desperately, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle for the mountain produced still bloodier combats. A hermita
      crowned the height, and the chapel was held by a regiment of Portuguese
      Caçadores. Against it a column issued from Sauroren, and, heedless of a
      sweeping fire that fell upon it with deadly violence, as in close order it
      steadily pushed up the hill, the ridge was crowned, and the Caçadores
      obliged to abandon the hermita. But Ross&rsquo;s brigade were at hand, and with
      a headlong charge the heights were cleared, and the chapel recovered with
      the bayonet. A second time the French rallied, advanced, and were repulsed&mdash;but
      other columns were coming into action. The right flank of Ross&rsquo;s brigade
      became exposed&mdash;for a Portuguese battalion gave way&mdash;a heavy
      column of the enemy pressed on, and the British regiments retired for a
      time, but was only to return more fiercely to the attack. &ldquo;Charge
      succeeded charge, and each side yielded and recovered by turns.&rdquo; At that
      moment, Byng&rsquo;s brigade rapidly advanced; while two noble regiments of
      Anson&rsquo;s&mdash;the 27th and 48th&mdash;rushed from the centre, bore down
      everything before them, and the French were literally pushed down the
      heights by close and murderous fighting, which Wellington termed &ldquo;bludgeon
      work.&rdquo; On the hill occupied the 40th and Spaniards, Reille&rsquo;s attack had
      failed for, although the regiment of El Pravia gwe way, flanked by a
      Portuguese battalion, the 40th held its ground immovably. Four times the
      French topped the height&mdash;four times they were pushed down by the
      bayonet; each charge heralded by a cheer, and each repulse bloodier than
      the preceding one; until, at last, strength and spirit equally exhausted,
      they refused to follow their officers and gave up the trial in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 29th passed quietly&mdash;both sides required rest&mdash;and to each
      some time was necessary to get their dispersed brigades again together.
      Not a shot was interchanged that day; but never did a more ominous
      tranquillity forerun the hurricane of war. It was now evident that all
      idea of re-entering Spain must be abandoned. The front displayed by Lord
      Wellington was not to be forced; and the French cavalry and artillery&mdash;only
      encumbrances in a mountain-country&mdash;were ordered to fall back and
      retire to the Bidassao. While waiting for D&rsquo;Erlon to come up, Soult
      received intelligence which induced him to change his original plans, and
      he determined to throw himself between the allies and the valley of the
      Bastan, thus securing a close communication with the French frontier, and
      falling back on his reserves, while, by a bold and well-combined movement,
      he might fortunately effect one great object of his advance into the
      passes of the Pyrenees,&mdash;the relief of San Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although unhappily non-combatant, still the operations of the contending
      armies which, day after day were severely engaged, or placed in the
      immediate presence of each other, to us were of absorbing interest. The
      first reports that reached the fortress were sadly disheartening; but on
      the fourth morning, a striking alteration was visible on the countenance
      of our friend Cammaran, when he called to announce &ldquo;tidings from the
      host.&rdquo; His mercurial temperament, yesterday in the very ascendant of fever
      heat, had sank almost to zero, and it was very amusing to observe the
      ingenuity with which, while admitting stubborn facts, he still endeavoured
      to apply palliatives to his disappointment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;sacre! what a country to operate in! Legs were of no use among
      those accursed Pyrenees,&mdash;men should have wings. What splendid
      combinations were those of the Emperor&rsquo;s lieutenant! Only for broken
      roads, ruined bridges, infernal gullies, and inaccessible mountains, the
      Duc&rsquo;s movement would have been a march of victory. He would have been at
      Vittoria on the 16th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; I said, breaking in on the detail with a laugh&mdash;&ldquo;He would
      never be contented to stop there. Why not push for Madrid at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you smile,&rdquo; my friend replied Cammaran, with a sigh. &ldquo;But, peste! the
      d&mdash;&mdash;d fogs confused the general movements. One division went
      astray&mdash;another was obliged to halt&mdash;columns marching over
      precipices could not keep time. Ah! those accidents saved my Lord
      Wellington; the delay enabled him to collect his scattered corps, and when
      the Marshal cleared those infernal valleys and defiles with scarcely half
      the <i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i> disposable, there&mdash;Sacre Dieu! was your
      general in front of Pampeluna with all his divisions up and in position!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And honest Jack Soult discovered that all his magnificent combinations
      and previous success, had ended in his catching a Tartar!&mdash;Ah!
      Cammaran, I feel for you, my poor friend. But out with it at once&mdash;or
      I&rsquo;ll compassionately do it for you. The upshot is, you have got a
      confounded thrashing&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no;&rdquo; exclaimed the Voltigeur. &ldquo;The plan of operations
      is only changed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Emperor&rsquo;s lieutenant has postponed the birth-day entertainment;
      and, in place of resting on the Zodorra, he will be over the Bidassao in a
      day or two. Well, I can feel for you. But custom reconciles people to
      contingencies; and latterly you have been so regularly beaten that it is a
      novelty no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Voltigeur smiled, shrugged his shoulders, pleaded duty in excuse for a
      brief visit, and hurried away&mdash;I suspect to avoid my <i>badinage</i>,
      which, at the time, was anything but agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, judging from the scanty information I received, the deductions I
      had drawn of ulterior consequences proved correct. As yet the French
      Marshal had only witnessed the complete miscarriage of all he had designed
      and hoped for: but now, the penalty of the failure was about to be
      exacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of his altered plans, on entering the valley of Ulzema, where
      he overtook D&rsquo;Erlon, who had already reached it at the head of five
      divisions, and with a sixth (Martinier&rsquo;s) in his rear, the French. Marshal
      instantly determined to crush the corps under Sir Rowland Hill posted on
      the ridge of Buenza. All was in his favour&mdash;the allies were scarcely
      half his strength, and the left of their position was vulnerable. The
      attack was fiercely made, as fiercely repulsed, and every effort against
      the allied flanks was unsuccessful. Finally, numbers enabled the French
      marshal to turn the position: but Hill steadily retired on Equaros, and
      there, joined by Campbell&rsquo;s Portuguese brigade and Morillo&rsquo;s Spaniards, he
      again boldly stood his ground and offered battle. But Soult declined an
      action&mdash;and, contented with having gained the Isurzun road, he
      determined to force his way to San Sebastian; but it was decreed that,
      like Pampeluna, the fortress on the Urumea should be abandoned to its
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wellington had penetrated the designs of his able opponent, and, with
      characteristic decision, prepared to meet them with a counterstroke. With
      him, to decide and execute were synonymous; and in the second conflict at
      Sauroren, the intended blow was hewily delivered. It will be enough to say
      that, in the conflicts which ensued, the French were completely beaten. On
      the allied side the loss of men was heavy in killed and wounded, amounting
      to eighteen hundred. On the French it was enormous&mdash;two divisions&mdash;those
      of Maucune and Couroux were almost destroyed&mdash;the general
      disorganization was complete&mdash;Foy cut off from the main body
      altogether&mdash;three-thousand men were prisoners&mdash;and nearly as
      many more rendered <i>hors de combat</i>. It was not the severe losses he
      had sustained which alone embarrassed the French commander. The allies
      everywhere were gathering around him in strength&mdash;his troops were
      overmarched and dispirited&mdash;his position untenable&mdash;all idea of
      advancing on San Sebastian abandoned&mdash;and the only door open for
      retreat was to gain the pass of Dona Maria, and by forced marches fall
      back on San Estevan. Accordingly, at midnight, his troops were put in
      motion to reach this dangerous defile, and thence, by ascending or
      descending the Bidassao, regain the French frontier. How painful this
      retrogressive movement must have been, may well be fancied. Now &ldquo;the
      leader of a broken host,&rdquo; and smarting the more keenly from defeat,
      because he had too presumptuously affirmed a certainty of success, and
      assured his troops of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more critical than Soult&rsquo;s position; and while Wellington
      supposed that he intended entering the Bastan by the pass of Villate, the
      French marshal was too close to Buenza to hazard a retreat by the valley
      of the Lanz. Indeed, his situation was so dangerous, that a less
      determined commander might have despaired. His only means of egress from
      these mountains was by a long and perilous defile leading to an Alpine
      bridge, and both were overlooked by towering precipices; while, from
      holding a shorter and easier line of march, the chances were considerable
      that Wellington would anticipate his movements, and reach Elizondo&mdash;Graham
      seize Yanzi before he could arrive there&mdash;Hill fall on his flanks and
      rear, if obliged, as he should be in these events, to take the route of
      Zagaramundi&mdash;and, in the end, even if he fought his way to Urdax, he
      might find that position preoccupied, and his retreat finally intercepted.
      Fortune averted the great calamity; but still safety was to be purchased
      at a heavy sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had dreaded, Soult&rsquo;s rear-guard was overtaken near Lizasso&mdash;was
      attacked&mdash;defeated&mdash;and saved only by a fog which opportunely
      covered a hurried retreat. At Elizondo a large convoy with its guard was
      captured; but the crowning misfortune was impending, when, ignorant of
      Lord Wellington&rsquo;s proximity, Soult halted in the valley of San Estevan.
      Behind the ridges which overlook the town four allied divisions were
      halted&mdash;the seventh held the mountain of Dona Maria&mdash;the light,
      with a Spanish division, were in hasty march to seize the passes at Vera
      and Echallar.&mdash;Byng had reached Maya, and Hill was moving on
      Almandon. Every arrangement to enclose the retreating army was complete,
      and never, in military calculations, was the destruction of an enemy more
      certain, than that which awaited Soult. Unconscious of his danger, the
      French marshal gave no indications of alarm. With him, there was no
      appearances to excite suspicion,&mdash;no watch-fire indicated the
      presence of an enemy&mdash;no scouting-party was seen upon the heights.
      Two hours more, and the fate of the Emperor&rsquo;s lieutenant would have been
      sealed, when one of those trifling incidents occurred, which in war will
      render the most studied and scientific efforts unwailing, and extricate
      from perilous results, those who have dared too much, but to whom despair
      is happily a stranger. Possibly, in the varied fortunes of a life &ldquo;crowded
      with events,&rdquo; never did accident tax the Great Captain&rsquo;s philosophy more
      severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unseen himself, Wellington with an eagle&rsquo;s glance watched from a height
      the progress of his combinations. The quarry in the valley rested in false
      security, even when the falcon on the rock was pluming his feathers and
      preparing for a fatal stoop. A few French horsemen carelessly patroled the
      hollow, and although a hundred eyes were turned upon them, they saw
      nothing which could betray the presence of an enemy or excite alarm. At
      that moment three plunderers crossed their path. They were seized, carried
      off; presently the alarm was beaten, and in a few minutes the French
      columns were under arms and in full retreat: and &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; to quote Napier&rsquo;s
      words, &ldquo;the disobedience of these plundering knaves, unworthy of the name
      of soldiers, deprived our consummate commander of the most splendid
      success, and saved another from the most terrible disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although its total <i>déroute</i> was narrowly werted, no army suffered
      for a time more severely than the retiring columns of the French. Cumbered
      with baggage, embarrassed with the transport of the wounded, confined to a
      strait and difficult mountain-road, no wonder that the whole mass of
      fighting and disabled men were occasionally in terrible confusion. The
      light troops of the fourth division appeared upon their right flank, and,
      moving by a parallel line, maintained a teasing fusilade. The bridge
      leading to that of Yanzi was strongly occupied by a battalion of Spanish
      sharp-shooters. D&rsquo;Erlon, profiting by the inaction of Longa and Bareenas,
      forced the pass; but Reille was not so fortunate. The light division, by
      an unequalled exertion, crossed forty miles of mountain-country by one
      incessant march; and they had already crowned the summit of the precipice
      which overhangs the pass to Yanzi at the perilous moment when Reille&rsquo;s
      exhausted column was struggling through the &ldquo;deep defile.&rdquo; Never was a
      worn-out enemy placed in a more terrible position. On one side, a deep
      river with rugged banks; on the other, an inaccessible precipice, topped
      by an enemy secure from everything but the uncertain effect of vertical
      fire. The scene which ensued was frightful. Disabled men were thrown down,
      deserted, and ridden over. The feeble return to the British musquetry
      produced no reaction. The bridge of Yanzi could not be forced; and night
      came opportunely, permitting the harassed column to escape by the road of
      Echallar, leaving, however, the wounded and the baggage to the victors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last struggle was at hand. Soult, with an indomitable courage which
      even in defeat established his military superiority, by powerful and
      personal exertions, rallied his broken troops, and once more formed in
      order of battle on the Puerto of Echallar, with Clausel&rsquo;s diminished corps
      in advance on a contiguous height. But that stand gave but a
      breathing-time. Two British divisions were already pushed on to re-occupy
      Roncesvalles and Alduides&mdash;Byng was at Fadax, Hill on the Col de Maya&mdash;and
      the light, fourth, and seventh divisions in hand, and ready to fall on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affairs which followed were very singular, and mark the moral effect
      which success and disaster exercise upon the best soldiers in their turn.
      The light division was pointed on Santa Barbara to turn the right of the
      enemy, the fourth were desired to make a front attack by Echallar, and the
      seventh moved from Sumbilla to operate against Soult&rsquo;s left. Outmarching
      the supporting columns, Harness brigade, boldly assailed the strong ridges
      occupied by Clausel&rsquo;s division: and, with a daring courage worthy of the
      good fortune which crowned it, actually drove from its mountain-position a
      corps of four-fold numbers to his own. It is true that Clausel&rsquo;s troops
      had been beaten, overmarched, and dispirited. Already they had been thrice
      bloodily defeated; but that six thousand tried and gallant soldiers should
      be forced from a rugged height by a brigade not exceeding sixteen hundred
      bayonets, is an anomaly in war which seems difficult to resolve to common
      causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last affair was that of Ivantelly. On that strong mountain the French
      rear-guard had taken its stand, and although evening had set in, the
      soldiers fasted two days, and a mist obscured the heights, the light
      troops mounted the rugged front and drove the enemy from that, the last
      ridge, which, in the course of nine days&rsquo; operations, had been assailed or
      defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of those sanguinary and continued combats, known by the
      general designation of the Battles of the Pyrenees, the Allies lost seven
      thousand <i>hors de combat</i>. The French casualties were infinitely
      greater; and a moderate estimate, framed from the most impartial
      statements, raises it to the fatal amount of fifteen thousand men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with feelings of unqualified delight I listened to Cammaran&rsquo;s
      doleful admission that Soult was over the Bidassao, and the battering
      guns, which, under an alarm, had been embarked at Passages, had been again
      re-landed, and the siege was to commence again. Sufficient proof of this
      intention was quickly manifested, for the trenches were repaired, San
      Bartolomeo armed anew, and the convent of Antigua furnished with heavy
      guns to sweep the beach and bay, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the feelings of the governor and his garrison
      when the tidings of Soult&rsquo;s failure were confirmed, still, like gallant
      soldiers, they showed no lack of confidence in themselves, but redoubled,
      their exertions to increase all the means within their power of defence,
      and repel the second assault as effectually as they had repulsed the
      former one. On the anniversary of the Emperor&rsquo;s birth, the inhabitants of
      the city and the troops who invested it, were apprised of the event by
      frequent salvos of artillery; and when night came, the castle exhibited a
      splendid illumination, surmounted by a brilliant legend, &ldquo;<i>Vive Napoleon
      le grand!</i>&rdquo; visible distinctly at the distance of a league.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 19th, the long-expected siege-train arrived from England, and on
      the 22nd, fifteen heavy guns were placed in battery. On the 23rd another
      train was landed. On the 25th all the batteries were armed and reported
      ready to commence their fire; and on the 26th fifty-seven pieces opened
      with a thundering crash, and in one unabated roar played on the devoted
      city, until darkness rendered the practice uncertain and ended this
      deafening cannonade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the siege was what might have been anticipated, when
      Wellington, with adequate means, had issued his order that the place
      should fall. On the morning of the 31st the assault was delivered, and
      after a long, bloody, and doubtful struggle, the fortress was carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would that with the fall of that well-defended city the sad detail of
      &ldquo;siege and slaughter&rdquo; closed! &ldquo;At Ciudad Rodrigo intoxication and plunder
      had been the principal object; at Badajoz, lust and murder were joined to
      rapine and drunkenness; but at San Sebastian the direst, the most
      revolting cruelty was added to the catalogue of crimes.&rdquo; * Thank God! from
      witnessing that horrid scene, the fosterer and I were exempted. In
      accordance with Mark Antony&rsquo;s advice, I had determined to give General Key
      &ldquo;leg-bail&rdquo; and on the night of the 27th, Dame Fortune behaving towards us
      like a real gentlewoman, we contrived to get clear of San Sebastian before
      our friends the besiegers could manage to get in.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>early a month had
      passed&mdash;a month of dreary captivity. It is true there was not a
      prisoner within the walls of San Sebastian who had less reason to
      complain, but still I felt myself a prisoner. Cammaran. as far as means
      allowed, anticipated every want. I was under no <i>surveillance</i>&mdash;the
      city was open to me&mdash;I wandered where I pleased&mdash;and every
      sentry I passed saluted me. The voltigeur was a general favourite,&mdash;the
      story of his deliverance had been told in the garrison, and even with more
      romance than had attended it; and every French soldier we passed pointed
      out the fosterer and myself as the preservers of a gallant comrade. If we
      met a group of officers, the moniteur, the cigar-case, or the snuff-box
      were hospitably presented to me; and could Mark Antony have drank &ldquo;pottle
      deep,&rdquo; he had only to turn into a French guard-house, and every flask it
      contained would have been placed at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were my relations with the enemy; but the bearing of my host was
      sometimes hard to understand. It was professedly kind; but the manner was
      forced, and repulsive. His habits were retired&mdash;no overture to
      intimacy had been made&mdash;beyond the detached portion of his mansion
      where I had been located at the first, the rest of his domicile was to me
      a <i>terra incognita</i>. Of his establishment I had never seen but two&mdash;a
      particularly dark-visaged youth, with a cutthroat cast of countenance, and
      a woman of seventy who was deaf, or pretended to be deaf. Still, our wants
      wire carefully attended to, and at times Senhor Francisco asked after my
      health in a tone of voice that would lead a person to imagine the man was
      sincere in the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my conscience,&rdquo; observed the fosterer, as he presented himself one
      morning at my bed-side, &ldquo;I have a fancy this house isn&rsquo;t over good. If
      banshees played upon the fiddle, I would swear that I heard one these
      three last nights in the garden that we see behind the window of my room.
      Arrah&mdash;do you think the place was formerly a madhouse? Except Newgate&mdash;and,
      blessed be God, I can only spake of it from description, the devil a such
      a place for locks and bolts I was ever in before. Has the ould gentleman,
      do ye think, much money? Every window barred up like a watchhouse&mdash;but
      they would require, for all that, to be looked over, for I have managed to
      remove two of mine,&mdash;and if I live till to-night, I&rsquo;ll have a walk in
      the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;Mark; that will never do. We must not intrude upon Don
      Francisco. He may have some secret to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troth! and ye&rsquo;r right,&rdquo; returned the fosterer. &ldquo;May be he has a private
      still at work, or does a little in the coining. But, faith, no matter&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      have a peep to-night. But if he&rsquo;s forging notes, or making bad dollars,
      what can he want with the music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I hear a guitar every night, and two nights ago saw something very
      like a ghost&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather very like your grandmother&rdquo;&mdash;and I burst into a loud
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I knew you would make fun of me. Well&mdash;no matter. She was
      the height of Serjeant Antony, and he&rsquo;s six-feet-six without his shoes&mdash;and
      as white as your own shirt&mdash;not, in truth, that that&rsquo;s anything
      remarkable, for worse washerwomen than we meet with here you could hardly
      find if you were on the look-out for a fortnight. But there&rsquo;s no use in
      talking. There&rsquo;s a tall white woman parades the garden; and if I live till
      the old Don is fast asleep, I&rsquo;ll be through the window, if I break my
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess, that although I could not listen without a smile, to Mark
      Antony&rsquo;s description of the lady-like spectre that honoured the garden
      with her presence, and then and there discoursed &ldquo;most eloquent music;&rdquo; I
      felt, notwithstanding, a more than common curiosity on the subject,&mdash;and
      while I reprobated the fosterer&rsquo;s removal of the bars which obstructed his
      communication with the spot she haunted, as an act but slightly removed
      from burglary itself, still my scruples were easily overcome when he
      proposed that I should keep watch with him that night. The retreat was
      beaten in the fortress&mdash;supper-hour came&mdash;the host, as usual,
      presented himself, to make inquiry whether aught was wanted that had not
      been already provided&mdash;and then, after wishing us &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; we
      saw him secure his gate, and retire to that portion of his premises, from
      which, with all the jealous reserve observed in an Eastern harem, we had
      been, as we were pleased to call it, inhospitably excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mark Antony, &ldquo;I suppose the man intends to be civil, but he
      has the quarest way of showing it. Although it&rsquo;s his own wine we&rsquo;re
      drinking, the divil a drop he would ever take in company. Give me that
      Empecinado, after all! God forgive me! I did&rsquo;nt value him at the time, as
      I should have done. What, though he had an offhand way of shooting
      Frenchmen and hanging justices of the peace, the moment the job was over
      he was as pleasant a gentleman as ever stretched a boot under mahogany,
      But as to this dark-looking divil&mdash;why, we&rsquo;re here well on to a
      month, and he was never the person to say, &lsquo;Mister O&rsquo;Toole, have ye a
      mouth upon ye?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed&mdash;we finished a second flask of the surly Spaniard&rsquo;s
      montilano&mdash;and the fosterer proposed, that while we apparently
      retired for the night we should extinguish the lamps, and then commence
      our vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was accordingly done&mdash;and, gliding into Mark Antony&rsquo;s dormitory,
      we began our &ldquo;watch and ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unbroken stillness permitted the slightest sound to be heard
      distinctly; and we therefore conversed in whispers. The contrast that
      night in San Sebastian presented to the day, was singularly imposing. The
      deafening roar of the allied batteries had ceased, and the city was wrapt
      in a calm but ominous tranquillity. Too distant from the breaches, we did
      not hear the working-parties, who sedulously employed the hours of
      darkness in erecting new defences, and restoring others which the daily
      fire of the besiegers had destroyed. Another hour passed&mdash;no guitar
      was heard&mdash;no sprite &ldquo;wicked or charitable,&rsquo;&rsquo; flitted past the
      casement. We heard the reliefs go round&mdash;the sentries changed&mdash;and
      all again was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;Mark!&mdash;Mark!&rdquo; I whispered in the fosterer&rsquo;s ear&mdash;&ldquo;The
      senhor&rsquo;s montilano has been uppermost in your brain, I fancy, on these
      same night* when this musical apparition was afoot. Are you sure that your
      imaginary guitar was anything but wind whistling through the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the crosses in a highlandman&rsquo;s kilt, the music I heard,&rdquo; returned
      the fosterer; &ldquo;but whether it was a guitar or a fiddle I&rsquo;ll not take on me
      to swear. Stop&mdash;hush!&mdash;Holy Mary! If that&rsquo;s not music, the divil
      an ear has Mark Antony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fosterer was right. It was the distant tinkle of a stringed instrument&mdash;and
      at times I fancied that I heard voices talking in suppressed tones, and in
      the direction of that part of the building which senhor La Pablos had
      reserved so exclusively to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Hector,&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;ll call me drunk after this?
      What&rsquo;s to be done? &lsquo;Pon my conscience, I think Mister Pablos is anything
      but neighbourly, with his tea-party every evening, and not say to people
      who have done him the honour to take up their quarters in his house, Mr.
      O&rsquo;Halloran, will you, and that young gentleman along with you, meaning
      myself, step over, in the family way, and take share of what we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, upon my soul, I think it is, Mark!&rdquo; was my reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may as well take the loose bars out?&rdquo; said the fosterer, suiting
      the action to the word&mdash;and before I could put in a feeble
      remonstrance, he established an aperture in the casement, through which
      any one of slighter dimensions than a common-councilman could easily slip
      out. &ldquo;Hush!&mdash;the guitar again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay&mdash;and by Saint Patrick! some company to listen to it!&mdash;Oh!
      the divil a one of me will remain longer without hwing a peep at the
      party, if I can.&rdquo;&mdash;And as he spoke, the fosterer popped through the
      casement, and&mdash;I lament to make the confession&mdash;next moment I
      was after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found ourselves in a small garden thickly planted with shrubs and
      fruit-trees, and encompassed by a lofty wall; several narrow walks
      intersected it, and the termination of one was bounded by a wing of the
      Spaniard&rsquo;s domicile. Through a chink in the shutters, a stream of light
      escaped; and thither the fosterer moved silently, I bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt that from this apartment the voices and the music had
      proceeded which we heard in the fosterer&rsquo;s dormitory. I peeped in. A party
      was grouped about a table covered with game, fruit, and wine&mdash;and a
      lamp, suspended from the centre of the ceiling, enabled us to examine the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five men were seated round the board, which was also graced by the
      presence of two personages of the softer sex. I never saw a party
      collected at a supper table whose appearances and pursuits were evidently
      so opposite. A burly monk sat directly in front of the treacherous fissure
      in the window-shutter. He was of no ascetic order; but a Christian man, on
      whom good fare was not thrown away; and, even if the lamp went out by
      accident, one on whose honour you could place reliance, and drink with in
      the dark. Two others of the party wore the costume, and had the general
      air, of Spanish traders. The fourth was a man of wild and formidable
      exterior; his arms, his dress, his bearing, all betrayed that his was no
      peaceable profession&mdash;and Mark Antony hinted, in a whisper, &ldquo;that if
      the Empecinado had a brother in the world the dark gentleman with the
      pistols was the person, and no mistake.&rdquo; The fifth was an English seaman&mdash;at
      least his costume and carriage would infer it. He seemed a fine athletic
      man, and, though his back was turned to the casement, the fosterer
      observed in an under-tone, that the sailor would thrash the company
      collectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      In years and appearance the females were still more dissimilar than the
      men. One well advanced in life was tall, slight, deeply pockmarked, and
      generally forbidding. The other&mdash;she sate beside the priest&mdash;had
      scarcely numbered twenty summers, and on a lovelier face, a finer form,
      the eyes of two interloping Irishmen never peeped through a split in a
      window-shutter. &ldquo;Och! murder!&rdquo; ejaculated Mark Antony, <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the Ghost&mdash;and is&rsquo;nt she a darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One seat was unoccupied. To whom did it appertain? Our host, no doubt, and
      wherefore was he absent?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an ould troublesome thief he is!&rdquo; whispered Mark Antony, pointing to
      the vacant chair. &ldquo;Where the divil do ye think he&rsquo;s scouting to? when
      every body&rsquo;s asleep or better employed, as they are within. I only wish
      that we were of the company&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it a comfort to see his reverence
      set such an elegant example? How beautifully he raises his elbow&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what I call honour bright! No skylights, and he fills to the top every
      time the bottle passes him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! I thought I heard something move behind us.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my soul, I fancied, myself, that I heard a rustle in the
      bushes,&rdquo; returned the fosterer&mdash;&ldquo;If old surly is on the ramble, and
      drop upon us unawares, what a pretty figure we should cut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mark, let us return to our old quarters; we risk the unpleasant
      consequences attendant on discovery, without any object to be found&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See&mdash;the sailor rises!&mdash;and the sooner we&rsquo;re off the better.
      May God bless that pretty face of her&rsquo;s&mdash;if I could not stop here all
      night to look at it; but, come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We retired as quietly as we had advanced&mdash;the fosterer leading the
      retreat. No sound occasioned alarm&mdash;no ghost of Patagonian
      proportions crossed our path. We reached the lattice through which we had
      invaded Don Francisco&rsquo;s garden. Mark Antony pepped his head and shoulders
      through the aperture; but never did a man withdraw both more rapidly. A
      dark-visaged Spaniard pointed a pistol from within, while, without, a
      person immediately at our elbow, in a low, but peremptory voice, ordered
      us &ldquo;to stand.&rdquo; The tones were perfectly familiar; indeed, there was no
      doubt touching the identity of the speaker, for Senhor La Pablos stepped
      from behind one of the thick shrubs.

      &ldquo;So, gentlemen,&rdquo; he commenced, while every word came hissing ironically
      from between his teeth&mdash;&ldquo;Methought it was only Englishmen who were
      forced upon my unwilling hospitality. I was mistaken, it would seem, and
      appearances favoured the deception. I believed my house; was occupied by
      men of honour; but I have harboured French spies, it would appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;stop&mdash;Mister Pablos, if you plase,&rdquo; exclaimed the fosterer,
      &ldquo;divil a bigger mistake ye ever made in yer life. Arrah&mdash;what puts
      that into yer head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge men not by their assertions, but their acts,&rdquo; returned the
      Spaniard coldly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senhor,&rdquo; I said, addressing the angry host, &ldquo;you certainly have reason to
      question the motives of our midnight intrusion; but I declare, upon the
      honour of a British officer, it was entirely a silly trespass&mdash;one
      that I cannot justify, but one from which, towards you, no mischief was
      designed. Let it be overlooked, and I promise, that while we remain
      beneath your roof, we will confine ourselves to whatever portion of your
      premises it may be your pleasure to restrain us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain O&rsquo;llalloran,&rdquo; returned the Spaniard, coldly, &ldquo;whatever your
      intentions may have been, your conduct warrants me to draw very different
      conclusions than the motives you have been pleased to assign. The safety
      of myself&mdash;-my family&mdash;those who are connected with me&mdash;all
      require me to guard against treachery. True, it has rarely come concealed
      beneath an English uniform&mdash;and, I am half persuaded, you harboured
      no evil against me and mine; but you came here under a suspicious
      introduction. I am a devoted man, and now completely in your power. You
      have seen too much&mdash;and yet too little. In one brief sentence I speak
      your doom&mdash;a stern necessity compels me to be severe&mdash;cruel&mdash;if
      it please ye better. One course alone remains to be pursued; I must secure
      myself, my friends, my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her I took for the ghost,&rdquo; said the fosterer, apart&mdash;&ldquo;and the
      divil a foot I would have put into the garden but for the same lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Proceed, sir,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can make us safe, but death or deportation. Walk with me, sirs.
      &lsquo;Twere idle to remonstrate here, or to refuse obedience to my order&rdquo;&mdash;and,
      with the perfect confidence that he had made no statement which he could
      not effectually support, the Spaniard stalked on, and the fosterer and I
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Mr. O&rsquo;Toole,&rdquo; I said, as, like two convicted culprits, we
      sullenly retraced our steps. &ldquo;A pretty kettle of fish you have made of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;groaned the fosterer&mdash;&ldquo;the game&rsquo;s up. The curse of
      Cromwell light upon the country! Is&rsquo;nt it hard that a man can&rsquo;t slip out
      of a window to take a little air without having his throat cut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke we reached the extremity of the garden. La Pablos unclosed a
      door. We entered the same chamber where, two or three minutes since, we
      had witnessed a scene of social comfort. There the remnant of the supper
      stood&mdash;but the company were gone, and their places had been filled by
      personages of a very different, and a very dangerous exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to define their appearance. Their garb was that of mariners;
      in all besides, they looked banditti. My impression was not singular,&mdash;for
      the fosterer, in a whisper, declared that, &ldquo;compared with these villains,
      the guerillas were regular gentlemen.&rdquo; All were armed&mdash;and I should
      say, there was not a member of this respectable community, who, like Friar
      Tuck, would hesitate on resorting to the &ldquo;carnal weapon,&rdquo; were it needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our trial was shorter, even, than a drum-head court martial. Senhor
      Francisco stated the offence, and then simply inquired what the safety of
      the commonwealth demanded. The twelve judges were never so unanimous. In
      the multitude of counsellors there was but one opinion&mdash;and that,
      though differently expressed, resolved itself into one pithy adage, namely&mdash;that
      &ldquo;dead men tell no tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the apparent character of those around me, I certainly considered
      that I should be defunct to a moral before morning; but Mark Antony boldly
      demurred to the sentence: and put forward the reasons why death and
      execution should be stayed; but as the fosterer&rsquo;s plea involved a confused
      story about ghosts and music, I question whether it would have carried an
      overwhelming conviction of our innocence to the dread tribunal before whom
      we stood. As it turned out, however, we were not on the verge of death,
      but, happily, on the eve of deliverance&mdash;and in a brief space, the
      colour of our fortunes changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the senhor was listening, and with marked incredulity, to the
      fosterer&rsquo;s defence, a noise was heard without, and the personage who bore
      the appearance of an English seaman, but who, from his position at the
      table had eluded our former <i>espionage</i>, burst suddenly into the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is all this I hear about spies, and land-loupers?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Are these the chaps?&mdash;Egad&mdash;this here one,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to me, &ldquo;looks too honest to play traitor. But, what!&mdash;Do my
      eyes deceive me?&mdash;why, dash my buttons&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be possible&mdash;but
      it is&mdash;an old messmate by heaven! What, Mark&mdash;am I so changed,
      that William Rawlings is forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed the brother of the fosterer&rsquo;s mistress; and the next moment,
      like Homer&rsquo;s heroes, their hands were locked together, and the pleasure of
      an unexpected meeting, was expressed in sea parlance on the one part, and
      an eloquent admixture of English and Irish on the other, which must have
      been perfectly unintelligible to the auditory, as I could but partially
      comprehend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the host, a brief conversation put matters in excellent train. As
      regarded felonious designs, we received an honourable acquittal; and
      better far, the welcome assurance was made, that before two suns rose, if
      luck were on our side, we should be clear of the fortress and free as the
      ocean-bird itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to our own apartments, accompanied by William Rawlings. The
      senhor was full of mystery and business; and, I presume, the gentlemen of
      the spado school were equally engaged; and, consequently, from the sailor
      we learned the particulars not only of our host&rsquo;s domestic relations, but,
      what was of more importance, the means and the probability of effecting an
      immediate escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senhor La Pablos, it appeared, was a contrabandista, and did business on a
      most extensive scale. His principles were neither considered particularly
      nice, nor was he a patriot of the purest water; albeit, he hated the
      French with an intensity which Dr. Johnson himself would have admired. The
      senhor&rsquo;s antipathy to the invaders, arose rather from private than from
      public considerations. He had acquired much wealth as honestly as
      smugglers generally do, and, year after year, the invading commanders laid
      him under heavy contributions, and obliged him to disgorge extensively.
      Senhor La Pablos had also been blessed with a very young and a very pretty
      help-mate; and on a short excursion to the frontier in the course of
      business, on his return he received the unwelcome intelligence that the
      lady of his love had levanted the second day after he had bidden her a
      tender, but as he, &ldquo;good easy man,&rdquo; believed, only a temporary adieu. He
      had replaced her loss as speedily as it could be effected&mdash;and as the
      successor of the lost one was equally fair, and might prove, &ldquo;alas! for
      womankind&rdquo; equally frail, he secluded her as much as possible from common
      gaze; and, certainly, he had never intended that we, during our brief
      sojourn in his hospitable mansion, should have been introduced to the
      family circle. &ldquo;But now for more important matters,&rdquo; said the sailor; &ldquo;it
      would waste time to tell you by what course of events I got connected with
      these contrabandistas, and shut up for the last month in this confounded
      fortress. I think escape tolerably secure&mdash;but could we but command
      one hundred dollars, it were certain. These Spanish smugglers are cold,
      calculating scoundrels&mdash;every movement is made for a mercenary object&mdash;but
      if they receive the consideration for their services, they are
      proverbially faithful, even to death itself, in a punctual performance of
      what they have undertaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unfortunate!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Thrice the sum required is lying with my
      baggage outside, and all I am at present master of is this valueless ring,
      and a holy keepsake from my lady mother. Would your friends, Rawlings,
      deal in relics of marvellous value? for I doubt not that this I bear upon
      me is such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are true Catholics, I have no doubt; but I fancy they would prefer
      plain silver after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed Mary!&rdquo; said the fosterer, &ldquo;I wonder where the old lady got this
      charm,&rdquo; for I had drawn my mother&rsquo;s amulet from my bosom. &ldquo;She told you,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;never to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mark, I was directed when necessity pressed me, to use a free
      discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; returned the fosterer, &ldquo;we will never be in a greater mess,
      Mark. Open it, Hector, dear! Not that I believe in charms, although I
      remember an old man at home that would cure cows when they were fairly
      given over by the smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mark, your curiosity shall be gratified.&rdquo; I opened the silken
      envelope, unfolded a sealed paper&mdash;no relic was there&mdash;but, what
      answered our present necessities far better&mdash;an English bank note for
      fifty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;long life to her ladyship!&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t she considerate?&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mark Antony. &ldquo;Talk of relics&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that a beautiful one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will it answer our purposes, Rawlings?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senhor La Pablos would tell you not; but you will see how soon he will
      discover more dollars than we require, and take his chance. But no time
      must be lost&mdash;&lsquo;tis past midnight;&mdash;and within three hours we
      must succeed or fail. Get ready. When the time comes for the trial,
      minutes may crown or mar it,&rdquo; he said&mdash;left us to ourselves:&mdash;and
      while the fosterer made up a change of linen, I sate down, and conveyed,
      my parting adieus to my friend the voltigeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawlings was not long away. He returned, having completed every
      arrangement, as he said,&mdash;and the following night was named as that
      on which we should make the attempt that would ensure our liberty, or
      rivet our fetters if we failed. The fosterer and I retired, but not to
      sleep; and we were early afoot, and waiting for some more intelligence
      from the honest sailor regarding our nocturnal enterprise, when the
      captain of voltigeurs, as was his custom, dropped in to make his morning
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to congratulate or condole?&rdquo; said Captain Cammaran, when he made his
      morning call. &ldquo;You are pronounced fit for service by the surgeon; my <i>parole</i>
      consequently has expired&mdash;and no doubt you will be required in a day
      or two to interchange it for your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give it,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You are wrong, my friend,&rdquo; replied the voltigeur: &ldquo;nothing can result
      from your refusal but personal annoyance. You will be sent into La Mota,
      and, I regret to say, there the prisoners are miserably inconvenienced.
      Think of it well, O&rsquo;Halloran; escape from the fortress is nearly hopeless;
      why, then, add to the <i>desaremens</i> of captivity? Courage!&mdash;an
      application has already been made in your fwour: why not, at least, wait
      patiently until an answer is returned by the minister of war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cammaran,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the reasons why I should not be patient
      are manifold. In the first place. I am in love, and wish to return home;
      in the second place, I am sick of San Sebastian, and very weary of
      contemplating the surly features of my host Senhor La Pablos, agreeably
      diversified, it is true, with an occasional visit from an old Leonora,
      deaf as a door-post, and the attentions of an interesting male attendant,
      who, if he be not hanged within a twelvemonth, why I&rsquo;ll forswear
      physiognomy for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! indeed, and you&rsquo;ll have no occasion,&rdquo; observed Mark Antony: &ldquo;the
      gallows is written in his face, and, as they say in Connaught,&mdash;Master
      Pedro is sure &lsquo;to spoil a market.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! my good friend, I have a remedy for all,&rdquo; returned Cammaran; &ldquo;one
      poison neutralizes another&mdash;you must find another mistress: and if
      you are tired of your quarters, why we can look out for others which may
      prove more agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;don&rsquo;t refuse rashly. Tell them you will consider it
      for a day or two&mdash;and trust to the soldier&rsquo;s best dependence,&mdash;you
      call it, happily, in English,&mdash;&lsquo;the chapter of accidents.&rsquo; Farewell!&mdash;I
      will call early to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the birds will be flown,&rdquo; added the fosterer, as Cammaran closed the
      door and bade us, as we then believed, &ldquo;a last good morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never felt so impatiently as on that last day when I remained a prisoner
      in San Sebastian. The sun went gloomily to the ocean, the sea began to
      rise and break upon the beach, and with the evening as it closed, the
      weather became worse, and a very skyey appearance heralded a coming storm.
      Darkness came&mdash;the lamps were lighted&mdash;the ill-favoured
      attendant laid supper on the table, uncorked a flask of wine, and, as he
      always did, vanished without making a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will have anything but a poor opinion of that Senhor Pablos,&rdquo;
       observed the fosterer; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an inhospitable divil, or on the last night
      he had the honour of entertaining two gentlemen, he would have had the
      common manners to have introduced them to his wife, and taken a <i>dock an
      durris</i> with them afterwards. No matter&mdash;here&rsquo;s luck!&mdash;and
      who knows where we&rsquo;ll drink the same toast to-morrow evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were, indeed, difficult to say, Mark. But, hark!&mdash;footsteps are
      in the court-yard.&lsquo;Tis unusual. But, see!&mdash;the door opens. Is it
      possible? Why, Cammaran! This is a late hour for a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said the voltigeur; &ldquo;but I have a presentiment that you and I are
      about to part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt the blood mount to my cheeks. Were then our plans known, and our
      intended escape discovered?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean ye, my friend?&rdquo; I returned, assuming an air of indifference.
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I continued evasively. &ldquo;Warmly as, through your kindness, I may
      have been recommended to the War-Minister&rsquo;s consideration, I must not hope
      the application will prove successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake me. It is another chance that probably may end our
      acquaintance. I am on duty to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so are we,&rdquo; observed the fosterer, in Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, we are going to try a sortie. The general has most
      handsomely put the detachment under my command. If I succeed, I shall gain
      promotion&mdash;and if Fortune favour me, I&rsquo;ll sweep your works
      extensively before I re-enter the fortress. Well, these things are not
      effected without broken heads&mdash;and I have come to have a parting
      glass with two friends I estimate so dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of the visit relieved me from desperate alarm. The Frenchman
      sate for an hour and then took his leave, to make the necessary
      arrangements for the intended sortie, which was ordered to commence at two
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the voltigeur had cleared the court-yard, Rawlings, attended by La
      Pablos, presented themselves by a private door which communicated with the
      garden. The sailor&rsquo;s looks told that affairs went prosperously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is ready for our attempt. The French sally before daybreak&mdash;and
      in the noise and confusion on the land-side, we shall be enabled to lower
      ourselves from the curtain, and gain the beach. All depends upon ourselves&mdash;and
      for the fidelity of our associates, Senhor La Pablos holds himself
      responsible. You must shift your rigging, however&mdash;and here come your
      traps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ill-visaged attendant brought me two suits of clothes of such
      anomalous cut and composition, as left it impossible to say for which
      element they had been especially intended. The host and sailor drank to
      the success of the expedition&mdash;the bell from the tower of San
      Sebastian beat twelve&mdash;the fosterer told each stroke&mdash;and then
      put up a pious supplication to Heaven, that this might be the last time he
      would ever count the same!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he fosterer and I
      lost no time in making a hasty toilet&mdash;and in five minutes our outer
      men had assumed as ruffianly an appearance as that of any <i>contrabandista</i>
      in Biscay. The tower clock of the cathedral struck two; and I remembered
      that Cammaran had mentioned that this would be the hour on which the
      garrison would sally. Excepting the hollow moaning of the wind, and the
      occasional drifting of the rain against the casements, all around was
      still; and, dark as the night was, I remained gazing at the court-yard
      expecting the appearance of Rawlings and his associates, with all the
      intensity of hope and fear which a man will feel, when on the eve of an
      attempt that will achieve his liberty at once, or rivet his chains more
      closely than before. All was quiet&mdash;no ghost appeared&mdash;no tinkle
      of &ldquo;the light guitar&rdquo; was audible&mdash;when, suddenly, a dull discharge
      was heard from La Mota, and a shell, bursting over the bay, &ldquo;gave signal
      dread of dire debate,&rdquo; and announced that the sortie was being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within ten minutes the din of war &ldquo;disturbed the night&rsquo;s propriety.&rdquo; The
      guns of San Sebastian opened, the Chefre batteries thundered their reply,
      while a hewy fusilade on the isthmus, pointed to the place where the
      besieged and the besiegers were fiercely fighting; and where, for a
      doubtful result, death or distinction, Cammaran played the desperate game
      a soldier ventures. The fire went rolling forward, therefore, the French
      gained ground, and so far the surprise had been successful. At the moment
      a hand touched my shoulder&mdash;a voice whispered that &ldquo;all was ready;&rdquo; I
      turned&mdash;the speaker was William Rawlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I stood upon ceremony, and wished to bid Senhor La Pablo, and that
      comely dame, his lady, &ldquo;a fair good night,&rdquo; neither of the parties allowed
      the opportunity; consequently, I descended at once to the courtyard, and
      there found two ill-favoured gentlemen in attendance, and, under their
      guidance, wc proceeded to effect&mdash;or at least attempt&mdash;our
      deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort was admirably timed. The sally of the besiegers had been
      checked, repelled, repulsed; and the spattering fire which had hitherto
      rolled steadily forward across the suburb of San Roman, now rapidly
      receded, while, from the trenches, the fusilade became every moment more
      heavy and more sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting the court-yard of La Pablos, we made a sudden turning, entered
      a dark lane, and found two men in waiting. A few short sentences were
      interchanged in low whispers, and we proceeded under the guidance of one
      who seemed to have undertaken to pioneer the party. The firing every
      moment became more violent; and, as the scene of strife was on the
      land-side, the attention of the sentries stationed on the defences next
      the bay was misdirected. We gained the centre of a curtain connecting two
      bastions, unperceived; and, by means prepared already for effecting a
      descent, glided down the wall unchallenged, and reached the beach in
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the work went bravely on but the most hazardous part of the feat
      was yet to be performed. Although my poor mother&rsquo;s secret treasure had
      been required by the <i>contrabandistas</i>&mdash;according to their story
      to pay for the hire of a <i>chasse-marée</i>, as Jack Falstaff kept &ldquo;his
      charge of foot&rdquo; in light marching order, properly considering that linen
      was to be found on every hedge, so, our naval contractors prudently
      declined &ldquo;taking up a vessel&rdquo; especially for our transport, when one might
      as easily be borrowed without troubling the proprietor to become a
      consenting party to the loan. This arrangement was made known to Rawlings
      and myself, for the first time, when we had actually reached the water:
      but the Biscayan assured us that &ldquo;nearly a dozen <i>chasse-marées</i> were
      anchored at a stone&rsquo;s cast from the shore, and beside us there was a small
      fishing-boat, ready for the launching; we had only to row quietly out,
      slip into the first vessel we could find, take a peaceable possession, if
      allowed, and if not, forcibly eject the owners for want of civility; &ldquo;cut
      our lucky&rdquo; and their cable by the same operation, and then stand boldly
      out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, honest José,&rdquo; observed the sailor to the leader of the smugglers,
      &ldquo;it appears that we are to pay for our deliverance first, and fight for it
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person addressed returned an evasive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no matter&mdash;it seems the business must be done,&rdquo; continued
      Rawlings, &ldquo;and the sooner we go about it the better. Lend a hand, lads&mdash;Softly
      with the launch! we may be nearer our intended prize than we imagine. How
      fast the wind rises! Upon my soul, on a darker night or more unpromising
      weather, men never went on a cutting-out party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute the fisher&rsquo;s boat was in the water, and we embarked. It
      was one of those small skiffs in which women are frequently seen fishing
      on the eastern coast, and hence, we were crowded so closely as to render
      the least movement dangerous, the water reaching to the wash-streak of the
      boat. As the wind was dead off the beach we had no occasion to use our
      oars for any purpose but to direct our course, and out we went, drifting
      in the dark, and upon what the fosterer termed &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;was swimming the Sedana to this? Everybody knew that
      a river had a bank; but here, the first land we would touch on might be
      Achil Head or Gibraltar&mdash;and he, Mark Antony, would be glad to know
      what was provided in the eating-and-drinking line for this voyage of
      discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these speculations as to our final destination were speedily
      interrupted, for William Rawlings&rsquo; practised eye had caught the dim
      outline of two or three small craft riding at anchor. Silence was rigidly
      enjoined, and the Englishman steered the skiff upon the centre <i>chasse-marée</i>,
      and desired us, in a whisper, to board the moment the boat&rsquo;s gunnel
      scraped the vessel&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident that we were not to be so fortunate as to effect a
      capture by surprise. The heavy firing of the cannonade and musquetry,
      attendant on the sortie, had roused the crews, whom we heard distinctly
      conversing from deck to deck, as our boat neared their anchorage.
      Fortunately, from the extreme darkness, and the diminutive dimensions of
      the skiff, we were within an oar&rsquo;s length of the <i>chasse-marées</i>
      before we were discovered. To a hasty challenge, a contrabandista replied
      that we were friends&mdash;an assertion on his part, which subsequent
      experience proved much at variance with our proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lowness of her deck allowed us to board the coaster without trouble,
      and a short, scuffling fight ensued which was over in a minute. Although
      more numerous by half, the surprise of this nightly visitation distracted
      the Frenchmen, and they made but a feeble stand. One was flung overboard
      by a smuggler, an example promptly imitated by the fosterer, who took the
      same liberty with the person of the skipper&mdash;while three or four took
      the water of their own accord. Rawlings cut the cable&mdash;the jib was
      instantly run up&mdash;the vessel canted with her head to sea&mdash;the
      fore lug was set next minute&mdash;and, before, the astonished crews could
      persuade themselves that their consort was regularly carried off, we were
      beyond the reach of the few muskets which they managed to get hold of in
      the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief consultation followed our success; and it was agreed that we
      should stand right out to sea, to avoid meeting with any of the French
      privateers who were creeping along the coast occasionally, and also afford
      us a fair chance of falling in with one of our own cruisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning broke, we had gained an offing of nearly twenty miles. The
      fire of the Chofre batteries had recommenced with daylight; but a
      smoke-wreath, now and then, from the Castle and island of Santa Clara,
      with a grumbling sound, like that of distant thunder, and only when a
      squall came off the land, were all that told us that, with the sun&rsquo;s
      appearance, the deadly struggle had commenced anew. Other cares were now
      presented. Had the <i>chasse marée</i> aught on board that a prudent
      soldier like Major Dalgetty, would declare by every war regulation
      absolutely necessary? The inquiry produced a painful disclosure. On board
      this ark of liberty, there were salt fish and fresh water for a day&rsquo;s
      consumption! I thought Mark Antony would have fainted when the heavy
      tidings were gently broke by the chief contrabandista, who should, per
      agreement, have been ship-agent and commissary together. The truth was, my
      poor mother having been inhibited from imposing penance and fast on me in
      right of certain marital engagements, had laid upon the unhappy fosterer
      an additional quantity of both&mdash;and if there were two things on earth
      to which Mark Antony had an invincible antipathy, cold water was the one,
      and salt cod-fish was the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;re regularly murdered now;&rdquo; ejaculated my foster brother. &ldquo;Blessed
      Virgin! What the divil do ye call that dark gentleman who got the
      fifty-pound note? I would just like to ask him a civil question, if he
      intends sleeping quietly in his bed after nearly drowning us first, and
      starving us, as it appears he intends to do, afterwards. If we ever reach
      Ireland, by my oath, I&rsquo;ll take an action against him, and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist! You&rsquo;ll have no occasion,&rdquo; if my sight be accurate replied the
      sailor. &ldquo;The cloud is over her again. Keep the craft away&mdash;and ease
      the sheets a trifle. Right&mdash;by everything that&rsquo;s lucky!&mdash;a
      man-o-war brig! No mistake about that; a man can read it in the cut of her
      topsails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vessel which Rawlings had espied, in a short time was clearly visible.
      Under single-reefed topsails, jib, and spanker, she was close-hauled as
      her course required, while we flew down direct before the breeze. Santa
      Clara disappeared, &ldquo;the wide, wide sea&rdquo; was round us, the cruiser and
      ourselves the only occupants of ocean&mdash;and in an hour, we were safely
      deposited on board Her Majesty&rsquo;s eighteen-gun brig, &ldquo;the Growler.&rdquo; The <i>chasse-marée</i>
      was turned adrift as worthless&mdash;and a promise made on the part of
      Captain Hardweather, that we should be accommodated with a passage home&mdash;the
      Growler being on her return to England&mdash;while our companions,
      captive, and contrabandista, Tyrian and Trojan, should be put on board the
      first coaster we fell in with&mdash;none of the parties having the
      slightest inclination to visit the island home of liberty, and take up
      their abode in a prison-ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Cupid exchanged with Rolus &ldquo;for the nonce,&rdquo; he could not have afforded
      to his votaries more favourable winds. The Growler liked a stiff breeze,
      and during the run home she had no reason to complain. The fourth evening
      we were reported to be in the chops of the channel, and on the sixth, were
      snug at anchor in Spithead. No difficulty was occasioned in the
      debarcation of our personal effects; and, if all military adventurers
      returned in the same condition from the field of glory, I suspect the
      trade of war would not be considered as affording a safe investment for
      the capital of a younger son. During the passage home, a change of linen
      was effected by a friendly loan, and every outward habiliment, from shoe
      to schako, when we landed, was borrowed property. By the kindness of the
      brig&rsquo;s commander, I was introduced to a banker, through whose agency I
      raised the necessary supplies; and one brief day wrought on all a
      marvellous change for the better. The second evening, on looking in the
      pier glass of the hotel, I had some doubts touching my own identity&mdash;Mark
      Antony was of opinion that he should be scarcely recognized by his own dog&mdash;and
      William Rawlings had actually set two barmaids by the ears, and left an
      impression on the too tender hearts of both, which required a full
      fortnight to obliterate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey to town was common-place. The &ldquo;whips&rdquo; kept sober, and hence we
      had not the exciting incident of &ldquo;a spill.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbery being obsolete and utterly unfashionable even in the novels of
      these Boetian days, though we crossed &ldquo;a blasted heath,&rdquo; none called
      &ldquo;Stand and deliver!&rdquo;&mdash;and the passengers, one and all, seemed so
      apathetic regarding life and property, that one would have thought such
      heroic personages as Dick Turpin and Jerry Aberhaw had either not existed
      or that they were utterly forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three months had passed since letters reached me from England. The
      immediate advance of the army, the quick and constant series of events
      which followed it, my detention at Vittoria first, and my captivity
      afterwards, rendered it almost impossible that communications, addressed
      as they would be to the head-quarters of the fourth division, to which I
      had attached myself, should reach me during this short and adventurous
      passage in a life of &ldquo;marvellous uncertainty&rdquo; while it lasted. Brief as
      the season was that intervened since I had heard aught from those I was
      most interested about, how many &ldquo;changes and chances&rdquo; in that small circle
      might not have occurred? I envied the philosophy of the fosterer and his
      brother-in-law elect. Neither harboured a doubt that all &ldquo;at home were
      well.&rdquo; At home!&mdash;What does not that simple phrase embody? For a time
      I took courage from the example; but, when we reached the White Horse
      Cellar, whence the fosterer, &ldquo;with lover&rsquo;s haste,&rdquo; set out to claim a
      bride, and the sailor to embrace a parent and sister, to whom he seemed
      ardently attached&mdash;then, left alone, I felt all the dark forebodings
      of one who dreams of nought but happiness and yet tremble lest fortune, in
      some capricious humour, may have already dashed the untasted cup away.
      Thanks to the gods! these sombre doubts were nothing but &ldquo;idle
      phantasies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If ever the director of &ldquo;a leathern conveniency&rdquo;&mdash;cabs, gentle
      reader, were then unknown&mdash;was put regularly to the pin of his collar
      to keep time with an impatient gentleman, the unhappy wight who drove me
      was that person. At last we readied the street&mdash;I jumped out&mdash;paid
      honest jarvey double&mdash;inasmuch as he averred that his &ldquo;near-side un,&rdquo;
       a roarer before, was ruined for life by desperate driving&mdash;and &ldquo;the
      outsider&rdquo; would not be worth a bean for a fortnight. I knocked <i>piano</i>
      at the door&mdash;an old woman opened it&mdash;&ldquo;Was Mr. Hartley at home?&rdquo;
       She could not answer the question, for Mr. Hartley had not lived there
      these two months. Saints and angels! what misery! It was brief. A young
      lady-looking personage unclosed a parlour-door, and acquainted me that the
      arrival of some Irish relations had rendered it necessary for Mr. Hartley
      to take a larger house; that, for the benefit of country air, he had
      selected one some ten miles distant from the city,&mdash;adding, that the
      family were well, as a servant had called that morning with some message,
      from the ladies. She gave me my uncle&rsquo;s address, and in half-an-hour 1 was
      speeding to Bromley Park, as fast as a light post-chaise would carry me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some seven miles from town, the last village was passed, and the remainder
      of the drive ran partly through shaded lanes, and partly over open
      commons. At a roadside hostelrie, within a gunshot of my uncle&rsquo;s dwelling,
      I discharged my carriage, committed the light portmanteau which contained
      my wardrobe to the safe keeping of the landlady, and set out, under proper
      directions, to find the place where love and duty alike urged me to
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I easily discovered the abode of &ldquo;my fair ladie.&rdquo; The exterior bore all
      the appearance of respectability; and, though the light was but
      indifferent, the entrance-lodge, palings, and close-clipped hedges,
      announced it to be a gentleman&rsquo;s retreat. The mansion stood upon a lawn
      not far removed from the highway; lights flared from the lower windows,
      probably those of the apartment where the family were collected, and, by a
      singular impulse, I determined to escalade the enclosure, and have a sly
      peep, <i>incog.</i> at those within.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned from the high road into a grassy lane which skirted the palings
      of a shrubbery&mdash;and tried them once or twice, but they were
      confoundedly high, and in excellent preservation. I pushed on&mdash;not a
      practicable breach to be discovered&mdash;and my uncle&rsquo;s mansion seemed as
      difficult of <i>entrée</i> as San Sebastian itself. Should I proceed, or
      abandon the attempt as hopeless? &ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo; said Common Sense,&mdash;&ldquo;Go
      on!&rdquo; and Adventure, jogged my elbow. I hesitated&mdash;a circumstance
      kicked the doubtful balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an open gateway to a field, I perceived a horse placed in the
      keeping of some low-sized personage evidently seeking concealment under
      the deep shelter of the hedge. I spoke; none answered. Why was this horse
      in waiting? It looked suspicious. Some felony was intended; burglary, or,
      more probably, exhumation. I strolled on a few yards farther&mdash;three
      or four railings had been recently sawn through, affording sufficient room
      to creep in by, and, without a second&rsquo;s consideration, in I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed the soft green turf, and proceeded in a straight direction
      towards the mansion, guided by the lights which had first attracted my
      attention on the road. A clump of evergreens suddenly shut them from my
      view, and I paused to determine whether I should turn to the right or to
      the left. While still uncertain, I thought something moved within the
      trees&mdash;I listened&mdash;whispers fell upon my ear, and next moment
      two figures glided from the clump, and crossed into what appeared in the
      darkness to be a belt of young plantations, stretching along the lawn and
      reaching to the lane from which I had effected my entrance. Who might
      these men be? Poachers, in pursuit of game, or keepers, on the look-out to
      prevent their preserves from being spoliated. When I recollected the horse
      I had detected concealed beneath the hedge, I came to the first conclusion&mdash;the
      men, no doubt, were poachers; and the animal had been left in charge of
      some confederate, to enable them to carry up to town the produce of their
      night&rsquo;s marauding. In this belief, I proceeded cautiously to the hall,
      determined to apprise mine honoured uncle that knaves had &ldquo;broke his
      park,&rdquo; and possibly, might &ldquo;beat his keepers.&rdquo; But another scene, and one
      to me of deeper interest, drove hares, pheasants, and poachers from memory
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I cleared the clump of evergreens I found myself directly in front of
      the mansion, and as the windows reached nearly to the level of the lawn,
      the interior of the apartment was seen from without distinctly. All within
      bore the appearance of luxury and elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture, the plate, the paintings, the lights, were in perfect
      keeping with each other. In the panorama of life many such a scene may be
      discovered. It was evidently the dwelling-place of wealth&mdash;but not
      the abode of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four persons occupied the chamber, and formed a striking group. The <i>partie
      carrée</i> consisted of two persons of either sex. On a sofa, a man past
      the meridian of life seemed in earnest conversation with a lady, who was
      still in the pride of matronly beauty; the expression of her face was that
      of settled melancholy; and it appeared that he who sate beside her was
      offering consolation&mdash;but in vain. The lady was my mother&mdash;the
      gentleman, her brother, and mine honoured uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opposite side of the apartment the other twain were seated, and
      thither, after one hurried look at those upon the sofa, my gaze was turned
      and there remained. My father, with Isidora on his knee, encircled her
      waist with his solitary arm, while her head was resting on his bosom, and
      her hands clasped wildly round his neck.&mdash;Oh! what a change a few
      brief months had made! The sweet bud of promise I had first seen in its
      mountain solitude, had flowered into loveliness&mdash;and the woman, not
      the girl, was before me. Her face was turned towards the window, and as
      the lights fell upon it, every feature was distinct as if I stood beside
      her. Her&rsquo;s was not the calm sorrow of my mother&mdash;it was the wilder
      outbreak of the youthful heart, which vents its sufferings in sobs and
      tears; and while my uncle and his sister conversed in whispers, the voices
      of my father and my mistress were audible outside the window. I could have
      easily suspected the cause of all this grief, had I but looked upon the
      table and the floor. On the former lay an open post-bag, and several
      letters with broken and unbroken seals: on the latter, a newspaper was
      spread out at my father&rsquo;s foot, and, no doubt, the evil tidings it had
      contained occasioned the anguish and distress I witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! tell me not to hope,&rdquo; exclaimed the fair girl, &ldquo;I cannot dare not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was painful to listen to the reply. The voice endeavoured to assume a
      steadiness which its broken tones belied; and the feelings of the father
      and the soldier conflicted sadly, as the tongue held out false and feeble
      hopes, which the speaker&rsquo;s heart secretly believed to be illusory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grieve not, my sweet girl,&rdquo; said the veteran, &ldquo;He is only returned
      &lsquo;missing.&rsquo; No doubt Hector has been made prisoner, carried into the place,
      probably wounded&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded!&rdquo; exclaimed the listener, &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;Dead dead
      and I am for ever wretched&rdquo;&mdash;and again the head of the fair sufferer
      sank on the bosom which had supported it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot describe my feelings; my heart was bursting to announce my
      safety, and I only hesitated to know how it could be most safely done&mdash;a
      moment ended the doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not despair, Isidora&mdash;my <i>own, own</i> daughter.&rdquo; The words
      came choakingly from his lips&mdash;the word <i>daughter</i> was too
      trying the chances were that he was now childless&mdash;and he hastily
      turned his head away. I saw a tear stealing down his cheek&mdash;and when
      the soldier&rsquo;s eye is moist, the heart, indeed, is full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, my dearest Isidora, all may yet be well&mdash;Hector may live&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not control the impulse&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He does live!</i>&rdquo; burst from my lips involuntarily.

      flinging the casement open&mdash;&ldquo;True! by every thing providential!
      Himself! Hector&mdash;and in safety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, I jumped through the window. My lady-mother uttered an
      exclamation of joy, and sank back upon the cushions of the sofa. My
      mistress sprang from my father&rsquo;s knee, and fainted in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, you re-deposited the young lady upon the place from
      whence she came, and flew dutifully to the assistance of your mamma, Mr.

     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reader, I never reply to impertinent questions; but, <i>entre nous</i>,
      I rather imagine that the resuscitation of the elder gentlewoman, was
      entirely committed to her husband and Mr. Clifford.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> letter I had
      received on my return to the head-quarters of the fourth division, after
      my <i>séjour</i> with the Empecinado, had apprized me that events in which
      my future fortunes were involved, hurried rapidly to a crisis. My
      communications with England had then ceased; and, on my unexpected return
      home, I found I had opportunely arrived when my presence was most
      desirable, and the <i>dénouement</i> of the drama was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without wearying the reader with the details of my uncle&rsquo;s proceedings, we
      will bring their results before him, up to the evening when at Bromley
      Hall I popped so unexpectedly through a window, and frightened two amiable
      ladies into fainting-fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of a sultry day, the harvest had commenced, and, over a
      rich and picturesque expanse of country, far as the eye could range, the
      sickle was busily employed. On an elevation, in a domain of noble extent,
      a gentleman far advanced in years, was seated on a rustic bench, under the
      expansive shadow of an oak the growth of centuries. At times he looked at
      the busy and interesting scene which the landscape all around presented&mdash;and
      then resumed the perusal of a newspaper. The domain was Clifford Park&mdash;the
      old English gentleman was my grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side of a copse, not many yards distant from the bench where the
      owner of the park was seated, another and a very different personage might
      have been discovered. She was a gipsy-woman of middle age, and seemed
      busily employed in gathering sticks wherewith to cook her supper. The old
      gentleman looked at her with some attention. For the last three evenings
      he had remarked her at the same hour and on the same spot. The regularity
      of her appearance had therefore excited some curiosity&mdash;and,
      beckoning her to come forward, he took his purse from his pocket, and
      presented her with some silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving this munificent present, the gipsy curtseyed reverently to
      the ground&mdash;the old gentleman resumed his newspaper, and waved his
      hand as a signal she should retire; but she made a step closer to the
      bench, directed a speaking look at Mr. Clifford for a moment, then threw a
      suspicious glance around, and, in a low voice said, with some hesitation,
      &ldquo;We are alone, sir,&mdash;Dare I speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman for a moment regarded the speaker with marked
      astonishment. The manner, rather than the words, was startling; but he
      nodded a mute assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For many a week I have sought this opportunity; but you are so closely
      watched, that, hitherto, I dared not venture near you&mdash;I have tidings&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, woman, that can interest me,&rdquo; said the old man, with a melancholy
      sigh. &ldquo;There is nothing in this life to give me pleasure, and little
      connected with it that could cause me pain. No tie binds me to the world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you have a double one&mdash;the dearest to ordinary hearts, have
      you not a daughter and a grandchild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, woman,&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The humble instrument of Heaven, destined, I hope, to restore to the
      parent&rsquo;s arms, a child alienated far too long&mdash;Ah! here comes yon
      meddling priest! Would you even yet have the remnant of your days made
      happy, be here to-morrow evening&mdash;and, for your own sake, be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the old man impressively. The gipsy assumed her former
      attitude of deep humility, curtseyed to the ground again, resumed the
      bundle of sticks she had collected; and, as if she had not perceived him
      coming, turned into the direct path by which the confessor hastily
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met; the gipsy made her humble obeisance, which the priest returned
      by a searching glance. In the handsome features of the wanderer there was
      nothing to excite suspicion, and he simply asked &ldquo;what was her business
      with Mr. Clifford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a face beaming with delight at having received a large and unexpected
      gratuity, the gipsy unclosed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, reverend sir, what his noble honour has bestowed upon the poor
      wanderer!&rdquo; and she pointed to the silver Mr. Clifford had just given. &ldquo;It
      is many a long day since I was mistress of so much. Reverend sir, you are
      not angry at my gleaning a few sticks? Believe me, poor Mary will do no
      injury to the trees. You look a kind-hearted gentleman. Heaven grant you
      long and happy days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What will not the mystic influence of beauty effect? The cold churchman
      looked at the supplicant for a moment&mdash;a soft black eye was
      eloquently turned on his, as, &ldquo;with lips apart,&rdquo; disclosing teeth of
      pearly whiteness, the gipsy timidly awaited his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely she must have been in woman&rsquo;s noon-day!&rdquo; the confessor
      involuntarily muttered. &ldquo;You have the permission, you ask. Take care it be
      not abused.&rdquo; Again the gipsy curtseyed, and the churchman passed on&mdash;giving
      her, in return for an outbreak of ardent thanks, unbeliever as she was,
      his parting benedicite!

    <p>
      Days passed&mdash;the weather continued beautiful, and the lord of
      Clifford Hall might have been seen on his fwourite seat beneath the old
      oak tree every afternoon&mdash;generally, the confessor close at hand, and
      the gipsy gathering sticks in some of the copses at no great distance.
      Twice she contrived to convey a sealed packet to the old man unperceived;
      and, on the following evening, after he had perused their contents, she
      saw, with unspeakable delight, that what he had read was not displeasing.
      The letters were from his long lost son, cautiously worded to sound the
      old man&rsquo;s secret feeling, lay the ground-work of a disclosure, and prepare
      him for coming events.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the third evening before I had so very unexpectedly presented
      myself at Bromley Hall, that, just as the light was failing, a man,
      evidently in an excited mood, paced slowly back and forwards in front of
      the ancient oak in Clifford Park, which we have already described as being
      a fwourite spot with the owner of the domain. Besides the extended view
      over the surrounding country which this rising ground commanded from its
      crest, the front and back entrances to the park were visible&mdash;and
      towards both, the lonely visitor turned frequently an anxious look. At
      last, as if wearied with his solitary vigil, the confessor&mdash;for it
      was he&mdash;broke into a rambling soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange, what has delayed him&mdash;two long hours beyond the time
      he told me he should return! I can scarce believe that I am waking. He who
      for years has been the creature of my will&mdash;who thought as I dictated&mdash;who
      acted as I pointed out&mdash;who in my hands was but a mere automaton,
      whom I wound and directed as I pleased&mdash;that he should thus
      miraculously assume an independence, and break through the thrall that
      bound him.&mdash;By mine order, &lsquo;tis marvellous&mdash;&lsquo;tis scarcely
      credible! That cursed interview with his grandson laid the foundation of
      the whole&mdash;and yet I fancied that I had remedied the mischief, and
      extinguished the yearnings of natural affection which the youth&rsquo;s sudden
      appearance rekindled in the old man&rsquo;s breast. But the last fortnight has
      crowned the mystery. Three long years&mdash;the old man never penned a
      letter. Were private communications to be made, I was summoned to indite
      them. Was business to be transacted, the steward was always the
      amanuensis. But now, he sits for hours alone&mdash;and writes, and
      transmits letters daily, and by the hand of one who hates my creed, and
      with whom I dare not tamper. What can be done? Never was a game more
      critical&mdash;one false move, and all is lost. The tidings ot the evening
      too, are ominous. His lawyer to be here to-morrow his errand, strictly
      secret too. What augurs that but mischief? By every saint, I know not how
      to act. True, I have not let the harvest pass without gleaning plentifully&mdash;and,
      better still, I have secured the reward of many an anxious scheme. But to
      see the grand object of my ten years of toil and artifice slip from my
      grasp&mdash;even at the moment when the course of nature should have
      consummated the triumph of sound conceptions, ably and patiently carried
      out&mdash;Ha!&mdash;a horseman&mdash;&lsquo;Tis he&mdash;I&rsquo;ll reach the hall
      before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the steward rode hastily to the stables, the priest had reached the
      mansion and retired to his private apartments. There, he impatiently
      waited the return of his confederate&mdash;and, in a lew minutes, the
      steward presented himself. If the confessor fancied that himself had
      startling tidings to communicate, one glance at the steward&rsquo;s agitated
      countenance, assured him that heavier news had yet to be unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You seem disturbed. Has ought occurred to cause
      us more disquietude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stand upon the brink of ruin,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;whence comes the threatened danger?&rdquo; inquired the churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the grave!&rdquo; returned the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, holy father&mdash;well may you betray astonishment. One believed dead
      for five-and-twenty years not only lives, but actually resides within a
      few miles of where we stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom mean ye?&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Clifford!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the churchman. &ldquo;He died in misery and exile.&lsquo;Tis
      some impostor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the true man, by Heaven!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Think ye that one who hated him as
      I did&mdash;who was robbed of the object of his love who swore eternal
      vengeance, kept the vow faithfully, and wrought the secret ruin of him who
      wronged him&mdash;think you, holy sir, that he could ever forget one, at
      the same time, the offender and the victim. No&mdash;no&mdash;ordinary
      injuries pass from the memory in time but insulted love lewes a burning
      recollection in the heart, which death alone obliterates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the holy saints!&rdquo; exclaimed the confessor, &ldquo;your tidings are
      astonishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not heard the worst,&rdquo; continued the steward. &ldquo;Give me some wine&mdash;for
      faith, my nerves are sorely shaken by the occurrences of this afternoon.
      Fill your glass, father, and listen to a tale, singular and wonderful as
      any which, even in the confessional, may have reached your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that the object of my ride to-day was to trace, if possible, the
      person with whom the old man holds his dangerous correspondence. Every
      inquiry failed&mdash;and I was returning a sadder, but not a wiser man
      than when I left you, considering what channel I should next try to seek
      the information we require, when simple accident discovered the perilous
      position in which we stand&mdash;one that, in danger, infinitely surpasses
      any thing which our gloomiest apprehensions could have fancied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A short time since, a stranger, named Hartley, took Bromley Hall for a
      few months; and there he immediately removed his establishment. It was on
      a small scale, &lsquo;twas said, but in every respect that befitting a
      gentleman; and as Mr. Hartley was retired in his habits, and visited with
      no one in the neighbourhood, his arrival made no sensation in the country;
      he was scarcely known beyond his own domain, nor did any one inquire who
      he was, or whence he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my return this evening, after an unsuccessful mission, close to &lsquo;the
      George&rsquo;&mdash;a road-side house contiguous to Bromley Hall&mdash;my horse
      cast a shoe, and I stopped to have it replaced. While the smith was doing
      it, I strolled from the forge and sauntered down a shaded lane; within an
      open gate a fallen tree was lying, and as the evening was close, I turned
      in and sate down to rest myself upon its stem. Presently, at the other
      side of the paling, I heard footsteps move cautiously along. An opening in
      the fence enabled me to ascertain who the person was&mdash;and you may
      easily fancy my astonishment, when I recognised the gipsy woman, who, for
      the last three weeks, has been every day in Clifford Park under the
      pretence of gathering fire-wood. Although surprised for a moment at her
      appearance, I remembered that the wandering habits of her people throw
      them across one&rsquo;s path in every direction where business calls; I rose to
      return to the forge and resume my ride, when suddenly the gipsy stopped,
      looked suspiciously around to see that no one had observed her, then
      drawing a key from her bosom she applied it to a wicket in the paling, and
      the next moment entered the grounds of Bromley Hall, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange and mysterious fancies crossed my mind&mdash;I determined to
      watch her movements, but how was I to follow? I continued my researches
      along the park palings, and at last discovered an opening occasioned by
      the removal of several slabs, for what purpose I cannot pretend to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found myself in a thick plantation, left all to chance, and blindly
      wandered on. Imagine my surprise when, not forty yards off, I suddenly
      perceived the gipsy in deep conversation with a stranger. They spoke in
      whispers, hence I could not overhear a word that passed; but I saw
      distinctly a letter pass from her hand to his, and the action of both
      during their brief conversation was marked and energetic. At last the
      interview was over, and both returned towards the wicket in the paling
      through which the gipsy had entered Bromley Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The path wound through the plantation, and at not a yard&rsquo;s distance from
      the spot where I had concealed myself, but fortunately a thick holly hid
      me effectually, and yet permitted me to observe the faces of the persons
      who approached. Almost within arm&rsquo;s length the man paused suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And is he so far prepared for the extraordinary revelations which are
      about to be made?&rsquo; he inquired in a low voice that thrilled through my
      very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He is&rsquo;&mdash;returned this infernal agent. &lsquo;He knows that his grandson
      is recalled&mdash;that Hector&rsquo;s father is already in England&mdash;that
      his daughter is ready to fly to the bosom from which she has been so long
      estranged. Nay, more&mdash;I have darkly insinuated that many a wild
      youth, after years of wandering, has returned; and plainly hinted that a
      son lost to him so long might live&mdash;nay, <i>did live!</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I believe the evidences of my senses, holy father? Was it a dream?
      Oh! no, no&mdash;all was fatal reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; returned a voice, whose tones were unchanged as when I last heard
      them in this very room&mdash;&lsquo;Mary, your services have made me for life
      your debtor, and to his humble but faithful ally, I trust, in a few days,
      Edward Clifford will prove his gratitude.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clifford&mdash;the exiled, the discarded, the dead! What! he returned&mdash;received&mdash;restored
      to life! Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the confessor springing from his seat, and
      shivering to pieces on the table the wine glass which he had held untasted
      in his hand, while Morley recounted his strange adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, by every thing sacred!&rdquo; returned the steward.&mdash;&ldquo;On they passed&mdash;I
      caught a glimpse of his well-remembered features,&mdash;years and climate
      had laid their hewy imprint on them, but in outline, they were those of my
      former play-fellow. The light and springy figure of the boy were gone&mdash;and
      a stout and compact form now stood before me, and just such as I remember
      Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s was some thirty years ago. Holy father, Edward Clifford is
      alive, and not seven miles from where we sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not put faith in witchcraft,&rdquo; muttered the priest&mdash;&ldquo;but this
      strange tale of yours would almost make me a believer. Well&mdash;we both,
      it would appear, are on the eve of ruin. I, in expectations which I
      conceived to be sure as certainty itself&mdash;and your acquisitions, my
      good friend, methinks are sadly jeopardized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine jeopardized!&rdquo; exclaimed the steward&mdash;&ldquo;More than that, reverend
      sir&mdash;I shall be ruined, beggared, and undone. It is not the blow
      itself, heavy as it is, but the suddenness of the stroke that annihilates
      me. Could I but have had the warning of a month&mdash;in that brief
      interval, I might have so arranged, that when I bent to the storm&mdash;as
      bend I must&mdash;I might have sought another country, possessor of ten
      thousand pounds; ay, and carried with me too the rents payable a fortnight
      hence. If ever calamity fell heavily on man, it has fallen upon me&mdash;and
      by such agency&mdash;the only beings upon earth whom I, at the same time,
      hated and injured most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; observed the churchman, half in soliloquy and half addressing
      himself to his companion&mdash;&ldquo;the mystery is cleared&mdash;and the old
      man&rsquo;s altered bearing is now sufficiently accounted for. Worse yet&mdash;the
      mischief is beyond all remedy. One duped so long and so completely, when
      once the mind is disabused, becomes ten-fold more suspicious than they who
      have never been deceived. Mr. Clifford is exactly that sort of character.
      His thoughts and acts are now as clearly revealed to me, as if I had
      listened to every communication made by that artful woman, and read the
      secret letters he has written and received. For how long, did this
      returned prodigal mention to his female confederate, that these intended
      disclosures were to be delayed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phrase was vague,&rdquo; replied the steward. &ldquo;In a few days&rsquo;&mdash;ay,
      that was the term he used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A limited time, indeed, for action&mdash;but brief as it is, I will avail
      myself of the lull, and not await the bursting of the storm,&rdquo; observed the
      confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you leave <i>me</i> alone to face the coming tempest?&rdquo; inquired
      the steward, with evident alarm and surprise. &ldquo;Holy father&mdash;have I
      not ever been to you a faithful friend? have I not acted as you directed?
      have not my own interests been frequently sacrificed to yours? Has not
      your word with me been law&mdash;your advice implicitly followed&mdash;your
      plans zealously carried out? I was ever your ready and your willing agent&mdash;and
      now, in the hour of need and danger, will <i>you</i> desert me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause of a minute ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morley,&rdquo; returned the confessor slowly&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot see how my
      remaining here could serve you. You wish to delay events&mdash;to avert
      them would now be idle as to war against the elements. But how can
      breathing-time be gained? Mine own interests would make a short interval
      before discovery shall take place, as desirable as is respite to the
      criminal; but, by mine order&mdash;I cannot devise any plan that could
      promise even probable success. We stand upon a loaded mine&mdash;and who
      can say the moment when the engineer will fire the train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, reverend sir,&rdquo; continued the steward, &ldquo;have we not days to count
      upon&mdash;and what might not hours, were they but well-employed,
      accomplish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the priest&mdash;&ldquo;days certainly may be reckoned on&mdash;and,
      under ordinary circumstances, much might be effected in the mean-while.
      But in this case&mdash;one so hopeless and so desperate&mdash;when the
      very grave would seem to have given up its dead&mdash;and when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grave must receive the living in return. Ay, father, there is but one
      chance left,&mdash;Clifford dies&mdash;no alternative remains but death
      for him&mdash;or disgrace, and poverty, and banishment for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that,&rdquo; exclaimed the cautious churchman. &ldquo;Pause ere you act&mdash;and
      weigh well the consequences. England, for such experiments, is a dangerous
      country. Remember your former attempt on young O&rsquo;Halloran. What a
      disastrous failure! Four lives were sacrificed&mdash;while he, the
      destined victim, passed through the trial unharmed! &lsquo;Twere better,
      possibly, my friend, to yield to circumstances, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See myself impoverished and insulted. I am no favourite with the country,&mdash;they
      view me as an upstart&mdash;and often has that cutting truth been told me
      to my face. The tenants on these estates secretly dislike me. As matters
      stand, their bad feelings are not exhibited&mdash;but let the change come
      that we anticipate&mdash;then, like a cry of hounds, every voice will be
      united against me, and I must either skulk cowardly away, or be hunted to
      the death, while the man I hate, have hated, and will while life remains
      detest, he will be received with acclamation, and trample on a fallen
      enemy whose neck is already in the very dust. No&mdash;no&mdash;though
      life be lost in the attempt, near as he fancies himself to this, his long
      estreated inheritance&mdash;he never shall be nearer. Father, I start
      instantly for London. We must act&mdash;ay, and act immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of these things I remain in ignorance,&rdquo; returned the confessor. &ldquo;But if
      you risk this perilous attempt&mdash;safety and success in every mortal
      venture, depend upon two simple qualities&mdash;prudence and promptness.
      These two, in human actions, are worth every cardinal virtue beside.
      Farewell&mdash;I too have cares which, for hours to come, will keep me
      watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The confederates separated&mdash;each to carry out his own particular
      object. The confessor had only the future to regret&mdash;the past he had
      secured&mdash;and consequently, he had neither a necessity or a wish to
      join in Morley&rsquo;s dangerous experiments. With the steward, matters were
      altogether different. In rash confidence, all that he had cared for
      hitherto, was to accumulate&mdash;and hence, his ill-acquired wealth had
      been so clumsily invested, that time was absolutely necessary to enable
      him to regain possession of his property. That time could only be obtained
      by a fearful and perilous attempt. But no course besides remained&mdash;and
      Morley started that night for London.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was wild and blustering&mdash;doors creaked&mdash;windows were
      unusually noisy for that season of the year&mdash;and those who had a
      fire-side, were too happy to find themselves at home. &ldquo;The George&rdquo; was
      entirely deserted; for the stragglers who had dropped in after sunset,
      alarmed at the threatening appearance of the weather, took a hurried
      refreshment, and pushed forward to gain their abiding places before the
      fury of the night should break. Three trwellers, however, still remained.
      They had required and obtained an apartment for their especial use&mdash;and
      a fire hwing been lighted in the parlour of the hostlerie, the wayfarers
      there bestowed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One, who seemed to play the host, was a man of respectable appearance, and
      beyond the middle age. He might be a farmer, a lawyer, a trader&mdash;but
      it was clear he was not, in common parlance, a gentleman. The others were
      of a caste immeasurably inferior. One was tall, burly, and dark-visaged&mdash;the
      other, short, slightly-framed, and sandy-haired. The countenances of both
      were particularly repulsive&mdash;and a stranger would have found it hard
      to determine whether they were knaves, or ruffians, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who appeared &ldquo;lord of the revel&rdquo; seemed ill at ease. He rose from his
      chair&mdash;looked for a moment from the window&mdash;muttered something
      about &ldquo;foul weather out of doors&mdash;&rdquo; returned, sounded a hand-bell
      which had been placed beside him&mdash;ordered supper to be hastened, and
      brandy and water to be brought in, to fill the tedious interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order was obeyed&mdash;&ldquo;the maid of the inn&rdquo; departed&mdash;the door
      was closed&mdash;and each of the company, by an involuntary impulse,
      looked over his shoulder to ascertain that no eaves-dropper was near. He
      who played the host seemed in no mood for revelry, and merely sipped the
      glass before him&mdash;the lesser of the strangers also drank sparingly&mdash;but
      the tall ruffian turned down the tumbler considerably below its centre,
      pushed its diminished contents further on the board, and then leaning a
      pair of overgrown hands upon his knees, and bending forward until his
      head, by slow progression, had made a Turkish obeisance to the superior of
      the company, in slow and pointed terms he begged respectfully to inquire,
      &ldquo;what business had brought himself and&mdash;&rdquo; he merely pointed to his
      companion&mdash;&ldquo;on such short notice to the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business&mdash;and that, too, of consequence,&rdquo; was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned the stouter ruffian. &ldquo;Business is very well in its
      way&mdash;but I&rsquo;d like to understand the nature of the job before I
      undertook it. Light work is well enough, but when it comes, Mr. Thingembob&mdash;for
      I don&rsquo;t know y&rsquo;er name&mdash;to what we calls <i>heavy</i>, wot means, ye
      know, hemp or transportation&mdash;why then men must look about them, and
      ax a question or two before they takes on.&rdquo;

    <p>
      To this judicious remark the smaller of the two assented by a gracious
      inclination of the head&mdash;while the question, so homely put, appeared
      to have disconcerted their respectable patron, for he did not answer for a
      minute, and then the reply was evasive. After passing a flattering
      encomium on the character of the late Mr. Sloman&mdash;whose irreparable
      loss was deeply to be regretted&mdash;he hinted that, in his line of
      business, there was now a blank. His unhappy death, and the equally
      unhappy consequences which followed, had left a dreary void. It was
      impossible to find a professional gentleman equally talented and
      trustworthy. Undoubtedly, men of high honour and strong nerve could be
      found&mdash;and therefore, rather than run risks, he, Mr. Jones, as he was
      pleased to call himself, would prefer doing business with principals, and
      having no humbug among friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange epitome of life the scenes enacted at an inn would furnish!
      How dissimilar in rank, in object, in vocation, are those whom every
      apartment of this human halting-place receives in turn! The care-worn and
      the careless&mdash;the miser and the spendthrift. Opulence, with
      unassuming carriage&mdash;penury, vainly attempting to brazen out its
      wretchedness. A noble, in title old as the conquest, rests in this chamber
      to-day&mdash;to-morrow it will be tenanted by a bagman, who never heard
      that such a being as his grandfather had existence. This evening a bridal
      party occupy the inn. They dream of naught but happiness&mdash;theirs is a
      fancy world&mdash;their road of life is carpeted with roses&mdash;they
      leave next morning. Who, next in succession, fill the same apartment on
      the morrow?&mdash;a coroner&rsquo;s inquest, to ascertain what caused the
      suicide of a village beauty, &ldquo;who loved not wisely, but too well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Jones and his friends were thus engaged in the large, parlour
      upstairs, in a small back room behind the bar of &ldquo;the George,&rdquo; two other
      personages were comfortably located. One was the jolly hostess, whom
      nothing but &ldquo;rum and true religion&rdquo; could have upholden, seeing that, in
      the brief space of ten years, she had been thrice a mourner. Finding,
      however, that in marital luck there is no faith &ldquo;in odd numbers,&rdquo; she had
      judiciously concluded on risking the fortune of an even one; and, at the
      moment when Mr. Morley was bargaining with his amiable companions above
      stairs, the widow of &ldquo;the George&rdquo; was endeavouring to ascertain whether a
      matrimonial arrangement was likely to &ldquo;come off&rdquo; below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mighty cold place these cross roads must be in the winter; and I don&rsquo;t
      wonder, Mrs. Tomkins, that you&rsquo;re uncommon lonely&mdash;and especially in
      the long nights. How short the days are gettin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mister Magavarel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Macgreal, if you please, Mrs. Tomkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;but, as I was saying, I&rsquo;ll never get
      over Christmas as I am. Though I look stout and hearty, I am but a
      timidious sort of woman after all;&mdash;a fight in the kitchen knocks me
      of a heap, and noises after night put me totally from sleeping
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! then I pity ye, Mrs. Tomkins,&rdquo; returned the suitor; &ldquo;after sodding
      three dacent husbands, no wonder that a fourth would be in ye&rsquo;r way, now
      that the could weather&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on. It was only yesterday I was sayin&rsquo; to
      Mister Dominik, the black gentleman at the park, &ldquo;Dominik,&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d venture to go before the priest
      in company wid a woman, it&rsquo;s Mistress Tomkins, of the George, would be my
      choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it strange, Mister Macgreal, that you never took a wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I was over bashful when a boy, and feaks! my modesty never quitted me
      afterwards,&rdquo; returned Shemas Rhua, looking as innocently in the smiling
      face of the landlady of the George, as if he had never crooked a knee
      before Father Peter Fogarty at the altar of hymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shame on ye for a deceiver! If the honest woman who owns you in Connemara
      were but at your elbow, and overheard your insidious attempts upon the
      too-tender hearted Widow Tomkins, I would not be in your coat, Shemas
      Rhua, for all the rats and rabbits you&rsquo;ll kill this side of Christmas!
    </p>
    <p>
      To what lengths Captain Macgreal might have urged his treacherous suit, it
      would be difficult to fancy, but the sudden entrance of Mrs. Tomkins&rsquo;s
      attendant, fortunately for her lady&rsquo;s peace of mind, interrupted the
      further oratory of the false ratcatcher. She delivered some trifling
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; continued the maid of the inn, &ldquo;murder was written in a mortal
      countenance, you may see it in the faces of two of the fellows above
      stairs. Lord! if they stop here to-night, I shall never close an eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; inquired the ratcatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven only knows,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They came into the house about an
      hour ago, and from the appearance of their shoes, I should say they had
      walked some distance. They inquired for a Mr. Jones; and on being told
      there was no person here of the name, they called for some ale, and said
      they would sit down and wait for their friend&rsquo;s arrival. Presently the man
      they asked for arrived on horseback, dismounted, spoke to the others for
      some minutes, requested to have the use of a private room, and they
      retired together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it, the errand that brought them here is not an
      honest one. Could you but see the suspicious looks they throw round them
      when I enter or lewe the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know more of both themselves and the business that brought
      them here,&rdquo; returned the buxom widow. &ldquo;You must know, Mister Macgreal,
      that a dark closet I keep for my private use, is divided from the large
      sitting room up stairs by a boarded partition, and there are cracks in the
      paper through which you can see what passes in the other room, and hear
      every word that&rsquo;s said. Many a stolen kiss I&rsquo;ve witnessed there&mdash;and
      many a tale of love I&rsquo;ve listened to. Follow me softly. But, Lord! what
      was I going to do? Venture myself in the dark, and with an Irish
      gentleman! Oh! I won&rsquo;t move a step, unless Susan comes along with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour bright!&rdquo; exclaimed the ratcatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know there must be somebody left to mind the bar,&rdquo; added the
      spider-brusher.
    </p>
    <p>
      These observations were conclusive, and after an assurance of great
      discretion on the Captain&rsquo;s part, the lady agreed to venture herself
      alone, and even in the dark, with the bashful Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without occasioning the slightest alarm to the guests, who occupied the
      &ldquo;great chamber&rdquo; of the George, the ratcatcher and his fair companion
      ensconced themselves in the closet, and as it would appear, too, at a
      moment when the negotiation had assumed a business-looking character, and
      matters were drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We understand one another perfectly,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must allow it,&rdquo; replied the larger of the ruffians, &ldquo;that you have come
      straight-for&rsquo;ed to the scratch, Mr. Jones; and I hopes you vo&rsquo;nt take it
      amiss, that we axed that part of the coal should be posted before we
      undertakes the job. Ye see, it&rsquo;s what we calls heavy work,&mdash;nothing
      like greasing a man&rsquo;s fist before he commences, it makes him go at the
      bisniss slap, because he knows that the rowdy will be stumped up when
      all&rsquo;s right afterwards. It&rsquo;s now late enough, so if you&rsquo;ll show us the way
      into the park, and point the right-un out, we&rsquo;ll make matters sure
      to-morrow night, and no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied you will acquit yourselves like men of spirit,&rdquo; was the
      reply. &ldquo;Proceed down the lane that turns to the right, and when I
      discharge the reckoning, I&rsquo;ll mount my horse and follow. At the second
      gate&mdash;you will find it open&mdash;wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ruffians twain&rdquo; rose and left the room, their employer called a bill,
      ordered his horse to the door, and quitted the hostlerie. The Captain
      prepared to follow him, and having kissed the landlady, a liberty for
      which he received a severe reproof, accompanied, however, by a general
      invitation to drop in as often as he could, &ldquo;the George&rdquo; in a few minutes
      was totally deserted, and Mrs. Tomkins issued orders that her premises
      should be closed for the night, with a passing remark to her attendant, of
      &ldquo;what a nice man Mr. Hartley&rsquo;s keeper was.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> quarter of an
      hour elapsed before the confusion my sudden entrance into the drawing-room
      of Bromley Park occasioned the inmates, had entirely subsided. I ran
      briefly over the narrative of my capture and escape&mdash;accounted for
      the non-appearance of the fosterer&mdash;was assured, notwithstanding
      wounds and &ldquo;durance vile,&rdquo; that I looked particularly healthy&mdash;and in
      due course returned, as in duty bound, a shower of compliment. The Colonel
      was particularly anxious to know why a lodgment was attempted on the
      breach, without battering down the defences; and in support of his
      opinion, made some extensive quotations from Vauban and Carnot. He also
      wished to inquire, why the false alarm upon the land-side, when the globe
      of compression was fired with such success, had not been turned, like the
      feint of the third division at Badajoz, into a real attack? Mr. Clifford
      asked the exact date to which my last advices from England had reached me,
      that he should take up his details therefrom. My mother was solicitous in
      ascertaining how often Mark Antony had attended mass; and was rather
      anxious to find out whether the fosterer had fasted upon Fridays, and
      figured frequently at confession. Poor Isadora&rsquo;s were whispered queries,
      and more readily and willingly replied to:&mdash;&ldquo;Had I really thought of
      her?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Were the ladies of the Peninsula so handsome as they had been
      represented?&rdquo; The answer to the first was an ardent affirmation, and to
      the second I gave a faithful assent&mdash;for the finest features of
      Isadora&rsquo;s beauty were decidedly Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of two former acquaintances, Dominique and my loving
      countryman, the ratcatcher, induced the ladies to withdraw, and retire to
      their respective apartments. From the faithful negro I received an ardent
      welcome; and the Captain was graciously pleased to express his
      satisfaction at my return. Indeed, the outer man of the latter was so
      changed for the better, that I might have passed him on the road and not
      recognised my former ally. The eccentric habiliments in which he had
      migrated from &ldquo;the far-west,&rdquo; had given place to the smart costume of an
      English game-keeper; and as the Captain was a stout, careless-looking
      fellow, no wonder he had found fwour in the widow&rsquo;s sight, and had been
      pronounced by that experienced lady, &ldquo;a nice man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Dominique&rsquo;s congratulations, and Shemas Rhua&rsquo;s &ldquo;ceade fealtagh&rdquo; had
      been duly delivered, the latter, in sentences equally compounded of
      English and Irish, the ratcatcher announced himself to my uncle, as the
      bearer of important intelligence. He had been taking a turn round the
      park, he said, after night-fall, with the gun under his arm, on the
      look-out for poachers, and in the course of his rambles had dropped into
      &ldquo;the George:&rdquo; What occurred there he briefly detailed, with the omission
      of all love-passages between himself and the fair widow, and then he thus
      proceeded with his narrative:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I followed the sound of the horse&rsquo;s feet. When the rider reached the
      second gate in the lane, he dismounted, joined the other villains, and all
      three walked forward towards the broken palings, while I slipped quietly
      through the wicket, and, knowing my path well, was at the opening in the
      fence before they reached it. Only two of them came in, for the little
      fellow remained outside with the horse. They went along, trampling on
      broken boughs as they groped their road, while I kept the grass under my
      foot, and dodged them without being overheard. They made directly for the
      house&mdash;and when they turned by the clump of ever-greens, I ran round
      by the other side and hid behind a holly. I saw them steal to the window
      of this room, and look in for at least five minutes. They then fell back
      close to the bush that sheltered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re certain you know the man?&rsquo; says the dacent dressed fellow to the
      other thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To be sure I do,&rsquo; was the answer&mdash;&lsquo;he has a pair of arms, and the
      other cove but one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You see how easily it can be done. You can shoot him from the outside,
      and be safe on the high road before any body could give an alarm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The job&rsquo;s plain enough,&rsquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the moment it&rsquo;s done, mind that you be off at once to London&mdash;and
      for your lives don&rsquo;t stop to drink on the way. Attend to this&mdash;avoid
      public houses&mdash;and all trace of you is lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll be sure to meet us the day after?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sure as the sun will rise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And what time should we do the trick?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As soon after dusk as you can manage it. Earlier would not be safe. Can
      you conceal your arms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Easily&mdash;I&rsquo;ll borrow a poacher&rsquo;s gun from an old pal of mine. It
      comes in pieces; the barrel unscrews in the middle, and you can carry it
      in the hare-pocket of a shooting jacket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come.&mdash;You know the man and the place. Let us be off. I&rsquo;m too late
      from home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They returned through the plantation. As they approached the paling&mdash;I
      still hanging on their heels&mdash;I was sorely tempted to give them a
      barrel a piece before we parted; but I thought, as I had found out all
      they were after, that it was better to let them pass this time&mdash;and
      inform your honour of what was in the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acted, gallant Captain,&rdquo; replied Mr. Clifford, &ldquo;with excellent tact
      and judgment. I see clearly through the business. My existence and return
      are discovered&mdash;and the wretch, who caused my exile, would now
      consummate his villany by murder. It will only expedite the <i>denouement</i>&mdash;and
      with the failure of to-morrow night, Morley&rsquo;s career will close. Come,
      Hector, we must not forget that you require refreshment&mdash;and while
      you sup, I will acquaint you with events which have occurred during your
      absence from the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While my uncle was detailing the progress of his secret operations, I was
      giving him ocular proof that my appetite had not deteriorated by
      campaigning. But even supper and a long story has an end. The clock had
      struck the first hour of morning&mdash;we parted for the night&mdash;the
      Colonel, by no means satisfied that the assault on San Sebastian should
      have failed&mdash;Mr. Clifford, to mature his plans, and avail himself of
      the ratcatcher&rsquo;s information&mdash;and I, to seek my pillow with that
      blessed and heart-cheering assurance, that all I loved dearest on earth
      were slumbering beneath the same roof-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Bromley Park we will carry the reader for a brief interval away, and
      follow the fosterer and his companion to the native village of the latter.
      It was sunset on the succeeding evening, before the stage coach on whose
      roof the pair were seated, stopped at the cross roads at a mile&rsquo;s distance
      from Rawlings&rsquo;s home, and there deposited the trwellers. Never did a
      couple of wayfarers cross a pathway more expeditiously. They had light
      kits and light purses&mdash;but they had what was better than any thing
      wealth could produce, lighter hearts&mdash;for from a fellow-passenger,
      William, to the inquiry, &ldquo;Doth my father still live?&rdquo; had received an
      assurance that the old man was well, and happy, and without a care, save
      what arose from anxiety regarding the safety of his absent son. Nor was
      the fosterer less gratified by the further tidings of the stranger. His
      mistress was looking better than she had ever done&mdash;at least, such
      was the village, report&mdash;and but a week ago, it was whispered that
      she had declined the hand of the wealthiest farmer in the neighbourhood.
      The colour mounted to the lover&rsquo;s cheek. To hear that his mistress was
      fairer than before, was flattering to his pride&mdash;but to find her
      constancy unchangeable, was incense to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights were sparkling in the village casements before the trwellers
      reached the termination of the pathway&mdash;and Rawlings with his
      companion passed through the garden by a private wicket, and unobserved,
      reached the rear of his father&rsquo;s cottage. The security and confidence ever
      felt in dwellings &ldquo;far from town,&rdquo; were here apparent&mdash;for the window
      of the little parlour was neither protected by shutter or curtain from
      theft or curiosity; and while the retired soldier luxuriated with his
      pipe, his pretty daughter was engaged in plying her needle busily, in
      perfect unconsciousness that the eyes of a lover were gazing fondly on her
      from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven bless ye both!&rdquo; ejaculated the warm-hearted sailor, &ldquo;We must not
      appear too suddenly; come, we&rsquo;ll step over to the Lion, and send the
      landlady across to tell father and sister that the wanderers are
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Rawlings was the pride of the village; every rustic coquette was
      flattered by his preference; and it was said that it was rather out of
      pique than love, that the miller&rsquo;s pretty daughter had listened to the
      suit of the jolly landlord of &ldquo;the Lion.&rdquo; Certain it is, that her
      reception of the handsome sailor was much more ardent, than wliat he of
      the spigot would have approved, had he been a witness to the unexpected
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, William, art thee alive, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive, girl; ay, and likely to live. I need not ask thee for Julia and
      the old man&mdash;I had a peep at both through the parlour window. Step
      over, dear Betsey, and let them quietly know that here I am, sound as
      British oak, and an old comrade along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! they will be so overjoyed,&rdquo; exclaimed the hostess, as she skipped
      across the street, and knocked at the old quarter-master&rsquo;s hall-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Betsey, is it thou?&rdquo; said the veteran, as he knocked the ashes from
      his pipe, and held his hand out to the visitor. &ldquo;What news, my girl?&mdash;girl&mdash;no,
      no&mdash;I must call thee dame now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look in my face,&rdquo; returned the pretty hostess, &ldquo;const thou not read good
      tidings there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean ye, Betsey?&rdquo; inquired the old man&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean?&mdash;nothing but what I say; I am the bearer of the best news you
      have listened to for the last six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it aught concerning my boy?&rdquo; exclaimed the excited quartermaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;William is alive and well; and of that an old friend of his,
      who stopped just now at the Lion, will give you presently, a full
      assurance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven, I thank thee!&rdquo; said the old man, as he reverently raised his
      eyes, and poured the brief offering of gratitude warmly from a surcharged
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His return!&rdquo; exclaimed the other female. &ldquo;Is he come home? Betsey&mdash;dear
      Betsey&mdash;end this suspense, and make us too, too happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the fair hostess, &ldquo;the sailor aeross the street is very
      like your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I will fly to him,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man&rsquo;s daughter, as she rushed
      towards the door&mdash;but in the passage her farther progress was
      arrested&mdash;a man clasped her in his lusty embrace, and covered her
      lips with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William, dear William&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia&mdash;my darling sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I not truly,&rdquo; observed the pretty hostess, &ldquo;that I brought you
      joyous news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment the wanderer was kneeling at his father&rsquo;s feet; and that
      night, had Britain been searched through, a happier family could not have
      been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that I have a chance of getting a civil answer, may I ask who
      that handsome young soldier is? I hope he is going to stop at the Lion for
      awhile. It would be a pleasure to serve a good-looking fellow like your
      friend, after being plagued waiting on frumpy farmer?, and answering
      beer-drinking boors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mistress Betsey, that same well-featured youth is a trusty comrade
      of my own, and a sworn friend of a wild Irishman my sister is slightly
      acquainted with,&mdash;a gentleman called Mark Antony O&rsquo;Toole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name seemed to have a magical effect. Julia&rsquo;s cheeks, in a moment,
      were dyed with blushes&mdash;a heavy sigh involuntarily escaped&mdash;a
      tear trembled in her eye&mdash;and a looker-on would have been dull
      indeed, who could not have read the secret of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo; said the landlady archly, &ldquo;no wonder Frank Robinson was rejected.
      So, Mistress Julia, and you would not confide in your old schoolfellow,
      and tell her you were over head and ears in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to be our guest for a few days&mdash;longer, probably, if you will
      make yourself agreeable. Julia, are you not obliged to me, my fair sister,
      not only for bringing myself safely back, but also for coming home
      provided with a brother-in-law, if you will only let me recommend a
      husband to you.&mdash;Hay, dear Julia, no tears&mdash;I but jest, you
      know, and would not wound thy feelings for the world. I will go over for
      my friend&mdash;&rdquo; He said, and left the room, accompanied by the pretty
      hostess. The old man resumed his pipe; and poor Julia ascended to her own
      apartment, to bless Heaven for the restoration of a brother&mdash;and
      weep, were the truth known, for the absence of one even still dearer to
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes passed&mdash;the hall door opened&mdash;she heard the
      well-known voice of the wanderer inquire for her, and presently footsteps
      were heard upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia&mdash;what moping here, and not down to offer a welcome to my
      friend! Well, I must fetch thee, girl!&rdquo; and William Rawlings unclosed the
      door. She started&mdash;the stranger was beside him&mdash;and she turned a
      look of displeasure and surprise on the thoughtless mariner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hay, don&rsquo;t look marlin-spikes at me, Julia. Here is the real offender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One glance, and the secret was disclosed. With a face beaming with
      delight, and eyes more brilliant now, &ldquo;For having lost their light
      awhile,&rdquo; she sprang into the fosterer&rsquo;s arms. The vows of simple but
      ardent love were mutually interchanged anew&mdash;and that night the
      happiest family in Sussex would have been found circling the
      quartermaster&rsquo;s parlour fire.

    </p>
    <p>
      The clock was striking two, when the steward, after leaving his horse in
      the stables of Clifford Park, walked hastily to the hall, and admitted
      himself by means of a private key, to the wing of the building occupied by
      the confessor and himself. On looking towards the chamber of the priest,
      as Morley approached the mansion, a thin stream of light escaped from an
      opening in the shutters, and told that the holy occupant had not yet
      retired to his pillow. The steward tapped gently at the churchman&rsquo;s door,
      which was opened by the occupant himself. &lsquo;Within, the room was in
      manifest confusion&mdash;several trunks and boxes were being packed&mdash;the
      grate was filled with the remains of burnt papers&mdash;and it was quite
      evident that the confessor was making such preparations as foreboded an
      immediate departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Morley,&mdash;What news? Has aught occurred since noon?&rdquo;
       inquired the churchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have determined to run the risk, and nothing now can change this
      resolution. The arrangements are completed. To-morrow night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the confessor&mdash;&ldquo;I neither wish, nor will know any thing
      of what is to happen to-morrow. It is enough for me to know what has
      occurred this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any thing important taken place?&rdquo; asked the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;two persons arrived this evening. They sleep to-night in the
      house. One I know to be Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s legal adviser. The other I fancy is
      to be the successor to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo; exclaimed Morley in astonishment. &ldquo;No, no! holy father! That will
      not be so hastily decided as you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;a short time will settle the question. After the strangers had
      been closeted with the old man for an hour, I framed an excuse, and
      requested to speak to Mr. Clifford for a minute. An answer was returned
      that he was engaged particularly, and orders issued that none should
      intrude upon him. There is a change indeed. <i>I</i>, refused admittance,
      who for years was constant at his side even as a shadow. <i>I</i>, who
      hitherto dictated who should be received and who rejected! Saints and
      angels! I can scarcely believe the thing myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward had listened with an expression of countenance, which evinced
      a sort of stupid incredulity. &ldquo;Father, are we both awake?&rdquo; he inquired
      with a sickly smile, that betrayed the inward workings of a bosom racked
      with disappointment and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, Morley,&rdquo; returned the confessor coldly, &ldquo;are the acts of a man
      fully awake to coming events. No papers shall rise in judgment against
      me;&rdquo; and he pointed to the fire-place&mdash;&ldquo;and, as you may perceive, I
      am preparing for a long journey on sudden notice. Have you been in your
      room since your return? I fancy you will find there a document laid upon
      your table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward instantly retired&mdash;his absence was short, and he entered
      the priest&rsquo;s apartment with an open letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so&rdquo;&mdash;and his white lips quivered as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis from
      the old man&mdash;brief, but to the purpose&mdash;I am rudely discharged,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directed to give an account of your stewardship,&rdquo; continued the priest;
      &ldquo;which may not exactly be convenient. What do you purpose doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avenge myself, holy father&mdash;leave Clifford Hall &lsquo;a house of
      mourning&rsquo; and, through the son, strike the cold dotard to the heart. Yes,
      if ruin impends on me, I shall involve others in the vortex. This time
      to-morrow, the stern old man who turns me as contemptuously away as I
      would spurn a beggar from the gate, shall be, what through life, and by my
      agency, he has been&mdash;childless.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is asserted that excessive joy, like agonizing sorrow, equally drives
      sleep away. When I retired to my conch, happiness and hope reigned in my
      bosom&mdash;and yet my dreams were light, my slumbers sound. I was early
      astir&mdash;but others were earlier still&mdash;and when I entered the
      parlour, I found the family party already collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all other breakfasts, ours ended in due course; the ladies retired;
      and Mr. Clifford, the Colonel, and myself, adjourned to the lawn, and
      there held a walking consultation. In fact, with his customary decision,
      my uncle had already made his dispositions. The intended bravos were
      denounced to the police; and at the very moment we were talking matters
      over on the lawn, Mr. Morley&rsquo;s agents were in close custody in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary that another day should pass, before Mr. Clifford deemed
      it expedient to throw off his incognito. It wore away. At Bromley Park the
      inmates were variously employed:&mdash;my uncle, in carrying out his
      successful arrangements; my father, in ascertaining whether a false attack
      on the sea-face of San Sebastian might not have operated as an effective
      diversion; my mother, I suspect, in offering additional prayers to Heaven
      for my safe return; and Isidora and myself&mdash;but, pshaw! the
      communings of young hearts were never intended for revealment.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the scene must change. At Clifford Hall the presence of two
      strangers was unusual; and, in that dull and sleepy establishment, that
      trifling event had occasioned some sensation. When morning advanced, the
      surprise of the household was considerably increased. The confessor had
      disappeared, having removed all his baggage, none knew where or how. The
      steward was also missing, but his apartments were in their customary
      state; and as he frequently left the hall for days together in course of
      duty, his absence occasioned no particular surprise. The churchman had
      departed for the continent two hours before the steward quitted Clifford
      Park, and, as it was fated, neither re-entered the domain gates after they
      had passed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear, that when he found his former friend and counsellor had
      left him to his resources, all Morley&rsquo;s self-possession vanished, and his
      future actions seemed rather the results of sudden impulse than of
      deliberate forethought. Without any fixed object, he took the road to
      London; and that, too, by circuitous routes, which rendered the journey
      unnecessarily tedious. Although his general habits were temperate, he made
      frequent halts at road-side houses, and drank freely where he stopped. It
      was late when he reached the metropolis&mdash;and on his arrival in the
      Borough, he put up his horse at an obscure inn, took some refreshment,
      ordered a bed he never occupied; for, as it afterwards appeared, he spent
      the night rambling through the streets, or drinking in low houses only
      frequented by the vicious and the destitute. God knows what the wretched
      man&rsquo;s feelings were! He then believed that a foul act was doing, or had
      been done; and it is hard to say, whether remorse for having caused the
      deed, or a savage exultation at its fancied accomplishment, had fevered
      his guilty soul, and, like another Cain, &ldquo;murdered sleep,&rdquo; and when
      innocence reposes, made him a wretched wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and at the appointed hour named to meet his myrmidons, the
      steward repaired to the place of rendezvous. He hastened on, as he
      believed, to learn the death of his victim; but it was only to hurry his
      own guilty career to its close. The wretched man, in thieves&rsquo; parlance,
      was &ldquo;regularly planted.&rdquo; The moment they found themselves in custody, the
      ruffians (both returned convicts) admitted their intended crime, and gave
      ample information by which their employer should be detected. It was
      arranged by the officers that Morley should be received by one of the
      ruffians, at the public-house where the meeting had been appointed&mdash;and,
      apparently blind to danger, the steward entered the tap and passed through
      into a back room, which had been notified to him as the place where his
      sanguinary associates would be found in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was squalid in appearance, ill-lighted, and in every respect a
      fitting place for villains to frequent. At a dark corner he perceived the
      larger ruffian at a table&mdash;and, what rather startled him at first, a
      stranger seated at his side. A brief conversation, however, explained the
      matter. &ldquo;The other cove had shyed when it came to the point, and he had to
      call on a trusty pal, the gentleman wot sate beside him.&rdquo; Thoroughly
      deceived, Morley fell into the trap laid for him, without harbouring a
      suspicion&mdash;listened with manifest satisfaction to a fabricated detail
      of the imaginary assassination&mdash;handed to the murderer the price of
      blood&mdash;and was about to leave the room, when the confederate ruffian
      struck a hewy blow upon the table with a pewter measure&mdash;announced
      that he was a Bow-street runner, and Morley his prisoner. Then turning to
      the door, he repeated the signal a second time. It was answered&mdash;three
      officers came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although astounded at the occurrence, the steward came to a sudden and
      desperate determination. The ruffian, hardened as he was, turned his eyes
      away in another direction from his victim&mdash;and, taking advantage of
      the momentary absence of the officer at the door, when summoning his
      fellows from below, Morley unperceived, took a small phial from his
      pocket, and swallowed the contents. He was instantly secured and searched&mdash;a
      large sum in money taken from his person&mdash;the handcuffs were being
      put on, which were to bind him for a time to the returned convict&mdash;the
      wretch who had betrayed him,&mdash;when suddenly, his look became fixed
      and glassy&mdash;his face livid&mdash;he reeled into the arms of an
      officer, and next moment, sank on the floor a corpse.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he second week of
      October was beautiful. The woods were tinted with the varied hues which
      autumn interposes between &ldquo;summer green,&rdquo; and &ldquo;snow clad winter.&rdquo; The sun
      shone brightly&mdash;the birds sang&mdash;the bells rang out a merry peal&mdash;and
      a bridal, in long array, swept through the long avenue of Clifford Park,
      and approached the village church. The road was crowded with all the
      rustic population of the neighbourhood&mdash;and, while the men hurrahed,
      the girls spread flowers along the churchyard path, when the young and
      beautiful bride left the carriage at the gate, and advanced to the portal
      of the sacred edifice. She reached the altar leaning on her lover&rsquo;s arm&mdash;and
      there, encouraged by the approving smiles of happy relatives and
      surrounded by a gaily dressed <i>cortège</i> of bridal attendants,
      interchanged her vows of constancy, and bestowed her plighted hand upon
      the youth who knelt beside her. The surpliced priest pronounced his
      benison, and closed the book&mdash;the holy ceremony was over&mdash;but an
      interesting scene remained. An aged man, on whose head the snows of eighty
      winters rested, had sate beside the altar in a chair, while the sacred
      rite was celebrated. When the churchman&rsquo;s blessing died away in the echo
      of the distant aisle, the old man signalled the young couple to approach
      him; they knelt at the feet of their venerable relation, who laid a hand
      upon either head, and with eyes devoutly up-turned, invoked Heaven&rsquo;s
      protection upon his darling children. The blesser was Mr. Clifford&mdash;the
      blessed ones, Isidora and myself.

      A second time the sun had circled the earth, and the same season had
      returned. Again the village bells were rung, and the park of Clifford Hall
      was crowded with tenants and villagers&mdash;that day it was the scene of
      rejoicing and festivity&mdash;an heir was born to the ancient name&mdash;and
      the baptismal ceremony was being performed within the hall, in presence of
      a goodly assemblage. From the font, the infant was carried in the arms of
      his young and happy mother to an easy chair, where a venerable man was
      seated. She knelt and invoked his blessing; and, upon the heads of two
      generations the old man&rsquo;s hands were laid, while his lips poured forth an
      ardent benediction.

      Again the year came round. It was later in the season, for withered leaves
      were spread thickly on the ground, a mute but striking type of life&rsquo;s
      decay. Slow and hewily the village bell was tolling&mdash;death was in
      Clifford Hall, and its owner was about to be carried to the tomb, where
      his forefathers were sleeping. Ripe for the grave&mdash;surrounded by
      those he loved&mdash;cheered by the consolations of religion, Mr. Clifford
      had calmly slumbered life away&mdash;his head pillowed on a daughter&rsquo;s
      bosom&mdash;his hand pressed gently within the grasp of a son, from whom
      for five-and-thirty years he had been alienated.

      The stranger who passes through the domain of Clifford Hall, will
      occasionally encounter a hale, stout, white-headed-man, in leathers and
      gambroon, with a gun under his arm, and two Scotch terriers at his heels.
      That personage was once intituled Shemus Rhua&mdash;but years have spoiled
      the <i>sobriquet</i>. At the back gate there is a picturesque cottage,
      with a flower-garden attached, and filled with bee-hives. There a handsome
      old woman will present herself, attended by a village girl. She bears the
      appearance of a faithful servant, who has retired with every comfort. That
      old woman was once Ellen&mdash;or the gipsy, as you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the immediate front of the Hall, two elderly personages may be daily
      noticed. One&mdash;stout, stooped, very gray, and very intelligent-looking&mdash;that
      is mine uncle. Another&mdash;spare, slight, and with a head erect as if he
      intended to throw Father Time off his shoulders, should he presume to
      invade them&mdash;his empty sleeve perfects the identity. Need I name my
      father?
    </p>
    <p>
      One more group remains. A middle-aged gentleman, and a lady, rich in the
      beauty of middle life&mdash;a throng of children, that would throw Harriet
      Martineau into hysterics, gambol round them, while a handsome old
      gentlewoman, whom they term &ldquo;grandmama,&rdquo; superintends their movements. If
      you cannot guess who they are&mdash;why go up to the steward&rsquo;s house upon
      the hill&mdash;and Mr. O&rsquo;Toole, or his pretty wife, will inform you.
